## Introduction

The public procurement module is being developed in collaboration with the Open Contracting Partnership to provide an improved mapping of:

- The extent to which the publication of structured and open data on all stages of the procurement process is required;
- The extent to which comprehensive and detailed public procurement data is available around the world;
- The extent to which procurement data is being used.

It builds on the inclusion of an Open Data Barometer indicator on public contracts data, and seeks to look at the connections between public procurement data and other key elements of public data infrastructure, including company information and public finance data.

## Prospective indicators


* [Governance: Public procurement data](../indicators/G.PROCUREMENT.PROC-POLICY.md) (G.PROCUREMENT.PROC-POLICY)
* \[Availability: Public Procurement Data\](../indicators/A.PROCUREMENT.Open Contracting.md) (A.PROCUREMENT.Open Contracting)
* \[Use: Procurement Data - Government Analytics\](../indicators/U.PROCUREMENT.Government procurement analytics.md) (U.PROCUREMENT.Government procurement analytics)

## Public procurement data and the public good

*Each indicator within the Global Data Barometer must contribute to an assessment of how far national policies and practices support governance, availability and use of data for the public good. This section sets out how a module on company ownership contributes to this.*

**Governments use procurement to spend public funds on goods, services, and infrastructure.** [Trillions of dollars every year](https://www.open-contracting.org/news/12-6-trillion-of-public-procurement-spend-each-year-is-opaque/) are spent through public procurement, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have purchased vast quantities of protective equipment and other supplies from the private sector.

Procurement is a key mechanism for states to deliver public goods of all forms. Better governance of public money through intelligent use of data is constitutive of the wider public good. This theme also relates to SDG targets 16.5 ( Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms) and 12.7 (Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities).

Increased availability and use of data on public procurement can be used to create more competitive markets for provision of services with public funds, decreased financial leakages, improved oversight by individuals and communities, and better service delivery overall.

Over recent decades, many governments have undertaken extensive public procurement reforms, including the introduction of electronic procurement systems, procurement portals, and mechanisms of community oversight. While public tender advertisement is a long-established practice, there is growing understanding that public information should be available on all stages of the procurement process, from planning through tender and award, to implementation. Provision of this information as structured data is fast becoming a global norm, recognising that data has the potential to power internal government analytics, increase private sector access to tender opportunities, and improve transparency and accountability of procurement processes. Sophisticated use of data in procurement can also enable a wide range of factors to influence decision making beyond price alone, supporting moves towards more environmentally sustainable and gender equitable procurement.

Building on principles and practices elaborated by the Open Contracting Partnership, this module will assess the extent of policies for comprehensive data on public procurement, and will take stock of the global availability of structured data on procurement planning, tender, award and implementation.

Recent research has outlined the multiple paths through which data use can improve public service outcomes, and highlights the ‘short path’ to impact through improved government use of data. As a result, this module will also focus on government use of procurement data and analytics. Separate questions on anti-corruption uses of data will include an element to check for cases where procurement data is being used.

## Use cases shaping this module

*As well as contributing to the overall Global Data Barometer scores, rankings, and evidence, thematic indicators may be used by partners or other stakeholders to address identified problems. The design of the Barometer follows a ‘publish with purpose’ approach, where we seek to maximize the value from each data point we collect and share.*

The Open Contracting Partnership will use data from this module to produce research and advocacy outputs on the state of open contracting practice, complementing their deep-dive analysis of countries publishing data to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS). This module is likely to find an audience amongst National Public Procurement Agencies, Oversight Authorities, Anti-corruption Agencies,, Central Public Administration authorities (Ministries of Finance in particular), National Audit institutions/Courts of Audit, Local public administration authorities, CSOs implementing procurement monitoring programs, International financial institutions (EBRD, World Bank, IMF), Transparency and Accountability Initiatives.

## Global relevance

*The Global Data Barometer will cover more than 100 countries, representing every continent and level of economic development. Indicators need to have a level of universality that allows them to be applied fairly across many different country settings.*

Although a small number of large countries contribute the majority of public procurement spend by value, estimates by the Open Contracting Partnership and Spend Network suggest almost all countries spend at least 3%of their GDP through public procurement, with the average spend above 10% of GDP: around 1 of every 3 dollars spent by government [(Open Contracting Partnership 2020)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?oJjp87). In almost all cases, the national government will carry out some level of procurement activities.

Although the services delivered through national procurement will vary, depending on federal structures and how responsibilities are divided between central government and sub-national units, we believe it is reasonable to focus assessment on national government procurement.

When looking at indicators related to diversity and inclusion, and access to contracting opportunities for commonly marginalised groups, there is a need to recognise different patterns of marginalisation.

## Secondary data

No secondary indicators are currently proposed for this module, although we will continue to explore the possibility of capturing metrics on the data capacity of the procurement sector through data from the [World Bank’s Benchmarking Public Procurement project](https://bpp.worldbank.org/) and [IDFI’s Transparent Public Procurement Rating project](https://www.tpp-rating.org/), and we will monitor updates to coverage of both the BPP dataset on conventional public procurement, and the [Global Public Procurement Database (GPPD)](https://www.globalpublicprocurementdata.org/gppd/) to assess whether these may be used in future to substitute or complement our primary indicators.

## Indicators from the Open Data Barometer

*This section outlines any relevant indicators included in our predecessor study, the Open Data Barometer, and considers how the Global Data Barometer may provide time-series continuity with these and where it may update or adapt them.*

The 3rd, 4th and Leaders Editions of the Global Data Barometer included a data availability indicator on Public Contracts, focussing on **award data**. This was defined as follows:

***Details of the contracts issued by the national or federal government.** When answering this question please look for sources that provide contract award data and not only requests for bids (i.e. details of the fact a contract has been put in place) If only solicitation/tenders are available, please do not consider the data available but still include this in your description of the data.*

The updated data availability indicator in the Global Data Barometer will support disaggregation of data on stages of the contracting process, allowing a more-or-less directly comparable benchmark (availability of award data) indicator to be generated. However, we are seeking to design an updated contract data availability indicator that will be sensitive to the availability of tender, award and contract performance information, and to the completeness of the available dataset (i.e. whether it represents just a few procurement processes, or all the procurement processes carried out by a country).

The proposed GDB indicator for contract data availability may allow countries with only tender information as structured or open data to score more highly than they did in the ODB (which would have given a zero score to a country with no award information), but it will also lead to countries with only partial award information, and without contract performance information, achieving lower scores than the comparable ODB indicator.

We note that the Open Data Barometer public contracts indicator was criticised as failing to incentivise high quality data publication: allowing countries to receive high rankings for providing *any* dataset of awards, providing it is openly licensed - and regardless of the utility of the data itself. This criticism was influential in shaping the updated design of Global Data Barometer availability indicators to include a more detailed breakdown of dataset features and elements.

## Other issue areas

In developing this module we have considered the potential to address whether policies or systems reference domain-specific data, such as structured sustainability metrics, structured data on public-private partnership projects, or detailed information on infrastructure projects (drawing on the [OCDS Public Private Partnerships profile](https://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/latest/en/), and [Open Contracting for Infrastructure](https://standard.open-contracting.org/infrastructure/latest/en/) respectively for these last two). We concluded that this would add considerable complexity to the module, and so have restricted the focus for the pilot edition of the Global Data Barometer to general procurement data points.
