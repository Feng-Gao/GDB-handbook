# Thematic modules

Data policies and practices are transforming almost every aspect of modern life. The Barometer explores data in context through a number of thematic modules, looking at the connection between specific data governance, availability and use practices.

## Thematic modules developed

For the pilot edition of the Barometer, we have experimented with a number of different approaches to developing thematic modules, including:

**Comprehensive modules** - where we have worked with partners, or independently, to design indicators based on existing policy frameworks, academic literature and in-depth stakeholder engagement.

For these indicators, we have carried out an assessment of the potential use cases for the data we will gather, and engaged with potential users of the data.

Modules in this category include:

* **\[Political Integrity\](Political Integrity.md)** - developed with [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en) and the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
* **\[Company Information\](Company Information.md)** - developed with [Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/)
* **[Procurement](Procurement.md)** - developed with [the Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org)
* **[Land](Land.md)** - developed with [Land Portal](https://www.landportal.org)
* **\[Climate Action\](Climate Action.md)**
* **[Health](Health.md)** & **[COVID-19](COVID-19.md)** - developed with input from the [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/) / [D4D](https://www.d4d.net/)

**Short modules** - where we have worked to update and extend existing Open Data Barometer indicators, based primarily on desk research.

We anticipate these modules could have additional indicators added beyond the pilot edition. For a number of these modules, we have identified that data can be primarily gathered from secondary sources.

Modules in this category include:

* [Energy Data](Energy.md)
* [Geospatial](Geospatial.md)
* [Transportation](Transportation.md)
* \[Crime and Justice\](Crime and Justice.md)

**Secondary data only** - where we have identified secondary data sources that can provide continuity with the Open Data Barometer, or add new elements to the Global Data Barometer.

These modules may have primarily indicators in future editions, but to manage the scope of the 2021 pilot will only include secondary data. The details of the secondary data to be used will be published following further internal review by the GDB team.

* [Agriculture](Agriculture.md)
* [Education](Education.md)

**Not included in 2021** - where we carried out initial scoping, but have not produced final indictors for the pilot edition.

* [Telecommunications](Telecommunications.md)
