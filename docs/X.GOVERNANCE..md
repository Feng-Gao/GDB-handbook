# Background notes & discussion

This section should contain background notes for the design of this indicator. This is a rough working area, and is not for publication. 

[MyData](https://mydata.org/) has developed into a global movement, supported by an international NGO (founded 2018, HQ in Finland, 90 organisations involved, 27 local hubs), focussed on giving individuals control of their own data. The **[MyData Declaration](https://mydata.org/declaration)** is signed by individuals and addresses:

1. Human-Centric Control of Personal Data
    - Understandable privacy policies
    - Individuals empowered to give, deny or revoke consent
2. Individual's as the Point of Integration
3. Individual Empowerment
    - Individuals should have tools, skills and assistance to transform their personal data into useful information
4. Portability: Access and Re-use
    - Individuals should be able to 'effectively port their personal data' in structured, commonly used, machine-readable formats
    - Related to: [OECD Individual Participation Principle](http://oecdprivacy.org/#participation)
        - Right to obtain information from a data-controller
5. Transparency & Accountability
    - Privacy terms and policies should reflect reality
    - Individuals should be able to see and control what happens to their data; and to understand how and why decisions based on their data are made.
6. Interoperability
    - Common business practices and technical standards
