# Methodology

![Global Data Barometer Structure: Governance, Capability, Availability, Use & Impact](https://globaldatabarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gdb-infographic.png)

The GDB is a multi-dimensional index, built of components and sub-components which are in turn built from composite indicators that combine primary and secondary data.

This means that, in order to develop an overall comparative assessment of the extent to which countries (or regions) govern and use data for the public good, we break the concept of data for the public good into various individual components and sub-components, each assessed separately. We then aggregate the results into an overall score.

Weâ€™ve designed the primary indicators in the Global Data Barometer survey to embrace what we learned across the editions of our predecessor project, Open Data Barometer.

The Global Data Barometer is based around four pillars:

* **Data governance** is concerned with whether there are rules, processes and institutions in place to make data available for the public good, and to safeguard against risks of data misuse. Governance indicators look at the overall legal and policy framework in the country, and at the governance of a sample of specific forms of data.
* **Data capability** is concerned with whether the country has the connectivity, skills and institutional capacity to create, share and use data for the public good. The majority of capability indicators will be drawn from secondary data, but a small number of capability questions are included in the survey.
* **Data availability** is the largest section of the primary survey, and explores whether certain categories of data are available, shared, and of adequate quality to allow re-use for the public good.
* **Data use and impact** is concerned with finding evidence of particular uses of data in the country.

The study is also organised through a number of **thematic modules** that, alongside assessing the overarching country context, look at the interaction of governance, capability, availability and use in specific fields - such as political integrity, climate action, and land governance. Thematic modules vary in size: reflecting the pilot nature of the GDB as we week to explore both depth and breadth of assessing data for the public good. 

Finally, there are a number of cross-cutting issues addressed in the Barometer, which may feature as sub-questions within a number of indicators. These include: sustainable development; data for development; openness; inclusion, gender and diversity; and emerging AI practice. 

## Time period

Each edition of the Barometer will focus on a particular time period. This means that researchers must focus on evidence and sources from this period, and should give answers based on their best assessment of the state of the country over the study period. 

The 2021 edition covers activities and evidence between **April 1st 2019** and **April 1st 2021.** 

This means that, in questions that ask about policies, strategies, capacity building interventions, dataset availability, or uses of data - these things should **have occurred or** **remained current** during the study period, and wherever possible, researchers should cite sources from the study period that show that this is the case. 

For example: 

* A country that had a **'Data Strategy 2015 - 2019',** but that does not have a more recent strategy document, would not be assessed as having a data strategy in this study period.
* A country that has a **'Data Strategy 2018 - 2022**', published in 2018, but with evidence that it continues to be iactive and mplemented, would be assessed as having a data strategy in this study period.
* Updates to a countries Data Portal on **May 1st 2021** would not be counted in the assessment for this study period.
* To include a use of data first reported in an article in **2016** in the assessment, the researcher must provide a citation or source to show that this use remains active at scale and/or has meaningfully developed in recent years.
* If COVID-19 has affected data availability at any point during the study period, this would count as a case of COVID-19 affecting data availability, even if changes have been reversed by April 1st 2021.

## Design principles

The structure of Barometer indicators, and the scoring approach applied, respond to a number of design principles. 

**Designing for different government structures**

While some countries set all policy nationally, many countries operate federal systems that mean aspects of data policy, availability and use are shaped by sub-national governments. We have designed indicators so that they can accommodate this. In federal systems, researchers are able to provide detailed assessment for a single sub-national context, and indicate whether this is representative or not of other sub-national contexts. 

**Inclusion and universality**

The highest scores in the Barometer are achieved when governance, capability, availability and use can be shown to be 'universal'. That is: everyone in the country is covered by, or protected by governance rules; everyone in the country has access to capabilities; everyone in the country has access to meaningful data covering their locality; and uses are broadly accessible and having impact across the country. 

**Bright spots design**

The Barometer adopts a 'bright spots' design approach where we want to collect data on leading examples of practice: even if these are not yet universal within a country.

1. For each country in the Barometer's expert survey, a country-level researcher performs desk research and consults with key individuals to respond to the survey questions and provide a justification for each answer. Many questions have suggested starting points, providing researchers with sources to work from. 

2. A research coordinator will carry out spot-checks on responses as they are completed, and will provide feedback on areas to improve. 

3. Once the initial survey is complete, a reviewer will carry check each answer, and provide comments or questions where they may disagree with the responses given, or require extra details in the justifications.  Reviewers may also have access to evidence provided by the government in response to a parallel government survey, and will use that to inform their comments. 

4. After review, the survey may be returned to the researcher to check each comment and make changes where required, or to add additional justification for assessments. 

5. Updated surveys are returned for a check by the coordinator or reviewer, and when they are satisfied with the quality of the assessments, the core GDB team will organize additional review of the assessments by thematic experts. Thematic experts may flag certain responses for additional research, correction, or clarification, leading to one last set of notes for the researcher to check and respond to. 

This iterative process will lead to a final set of well-researched and well-sourced indicators.

!!! note "A note on the government survey" 

	We are piloting a government survey model for the 2021 Barometer in which we will offer each government a list of the starting point sources that researchers are given. Governments will be invited to provide additional evidence that a researcher might not find from these starting points, and at the review stage, reviewers will be asked to decide if any of these government contributions should be taken into account to update indicator assessments. 

	We have chosen this approach (a) to allow the expert survey and government survey to run in parallel; (b) as based on past experience we do not anticipate a high response rate from governments, and we anticipate very varied levels of detail; (c) it allows initial researcher to begin from the same starting points, and avoids differences in research between countries with and without government survey data.
