# Methodology


## Introduction

In today’s data-driven world, data plays a pivotal role in power relations. Data can be exploited for private gain and to restrict freedom, and data can also be harnessed for the public good. When effectively managed, data can address social challenges, foster collaboration, drive innovation, and enhance accountability and transparency.

The first edition of the Global Data Barometer (GDB) assessed the data foundations necessary to develop and maintain healthy, inclusive data ecosystems worldwide. Its results provide critical insights for data governance, digital public infrastructure, AI preparedness, responsible digitalization, and data competency across regions. This second edition continues that work, tracing where and how data foundations are evolving. 

### The value of healthy data ecosystems

Healthy data ecosystems play a critical role in addressing a number of challenges the world is experiencing today. To begin with, we use data to challenge misinformation, disinformation, surveillance, and other harmful practices in this digital age that erode trust, polarize communities, and threaten democratic values. Robust data governance practices, promoting transparency, and encouraging responsible data sharing and data protection can ensure that the data used for decision-making is accurate, reliable, and trustworthy. Moreover, when governments produce and publish high-quality data and communities and individuals have access to it,  they can make informed decisions about their health, safety, and civic participation. This, in turn, strengthens democratic values, enhances public trust, and fosters social cohesion. Without a comprehensive understanding of existing capacities and available data, we risk undermining desired developmental outcomes.

In this context, the GDB emerged in 2020, building upon the Open Data Barometer (ODB) study conducted from 2013 to 2020\. Unlike its predecessor, the GDB delves beyond the legal and technical dimensions of open data to explore broader data landscapes encompassing governance, availability and capabilities.  In this context, the Global Data Barometer assesses essential data foundations \- infrastructure, processes, and strategies that underpin the effective collection, management, storage, publication, and use of data \- crucial for developing healthy data ecosystems. 

In this second edition, the methodology has been refined to better address  brightspots of use as well as relevant cross-cutting themes, as explained later in this document. Overall, the GDB provides globally comparable evidence on public data foundations and supports evidence-based decision-making and policy development—promoting positive change on a global scale. It provides a benchmark that makes it possible for governments to align policies with the concept of 'data for public good,' fostering a healthier data ecosystem that protects democratic values, enhances transparency, and ensures a more informed and enlightened global society.

This methodology document provides a snapshot of the second edition of the Barometer. 

## Looking back to the first edition

The first edition of the GDB was based on primary data from a global expert survey carried out in mid-2021 in 109 countries, which was combined with secondary data from trusted sources to generate a range of metrics.  The period assessed was May 2019 to May 2021\. The first edition was a pivotal opportunity to unpack issues such as privacy, protection of human rights in the development of technological interventions, AI, digital security, inclusion, and data governance within countries and across them.

## The Second Edition 

The second edition of the Barometer is a product of research, coordinated efforts to improve on the first edition results, and dedicated effort to refine and strengthen the survey tool. To measure country performance, the GDB employs an expert survey that was developed in partnership with thematic partners in different fields and drawing on an open, participatory process in order to have meaningful depth while also being broadly comparable, ensuring consistent and comparable evaluations across different regions. 

Much of the value of a multi-dimensional index like GDB is in its function as a learning device that offers us the opportunity to understand each country’s relative strengths and weaknesses in certain areas. For example, the GDB makes it possible to explore which countries have poor data frameworks data but have limited capability to make use of that data; or, within GDB’s governance component, the relative strength of data protection and data-sharing policies—and whether these strike the balance required to support public good outcomes in a datafied society. 

The Barometer is organised around three pillars: data governance, data capabilities, and data availability. This edition will:

* Evaluate data foundations crucial for developing robust and inclusive data ecosystems  
* Determine if general assessments align with data practices in specific thematic sectors.  
* Maximize the potential for data reuse within the broader research and policy community  
* Track data availability across several cross-cutting themes and action areas including but not limited to data use, artificial intelligence, equity and inclusion, accountability, and transparency.

### Key Definitions 

* **Pillars**: The Barometer is organised around three pillars or core areas of assessment—governance, capability, and availability.  
  * **Governance**: The rules, processes, and institutions in place to ensure data is available for the public good and safeguarded against misuse.  
  * **Capability**: The means, connectivity, skills, and institutional capacity required to create, share, and use data for the public good.  
  * **Availability**: The presence, sharing, and quality of specific categories of data to allow reuse for the public good.  
* **Thematic clusters**  are structured groups of related core and thematic indicators that have been adapted to provide a comprehensive assessment of a healthy data ecosystem. Each cluster focuses on a specific aspect or theme within the broader context of data governance, availability and capabilities. Within each cluster, there are action areas, which contain one or more indicators.  
* **Action Areas:** Within each thematic cluster, there are action areas, which are specific domains or topics of interest that are essential for evaluating the overall health and functionality of the data ecosystem. These action areas are often using multiple indicators from different pillars to trace intersections of governance, capability, and availability and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues.  
* **Cross-cutting themes**: Cross-cutting themes typically draw on a mixture of individual sub-questions and supporting questions, often distributed across multiple indicators, sometimes in conjunction with entire indicators or element subgroups. Cross-cutting themes are thus similar to thematic clusters, but rather than examine topics only in units of indicators, cross-cutting themes reassemble the different components of the survey in innovative ways to surface further insights.  
* **Indicators**: The GDB expert survey consists of 27 indicators, each composed of discrete sub-questions that generate weighted scores. Indicator questions are framed as ‘to what extent’ questions.  
* **Sub-questions**: Indicator sub-questions are organised in three sections: **existence**, **elements**, and **extent**;  
  * Existence sub-questions ask researchers to determine whether relevant frameworks, institutions, training programs, or datasets exist.  
  * Element sub-questions allow researchers to carry out detailed assessments, they build on existence sub-questions providing evidence within specific documents, datasets, and frameworks.   
  * Extent sub-questions are designed to explore whether what is being evaluated demonstrates comprehensive coverage or whether it has limitations.   
* **Supporting questions:** A supporting question is designed to gather additional qualitative evidence that helps substantiate or clarify the answers provided in response to a primary question. These questions dig deeper into the context or reasoning behind a response, ensuring that the answers are well-supported and accurate.


### Design Principles

The Barometer’s structure, components, and weighting respond to a specific set of design principles.

### Flexibility for government structure

While some countries set policy nationally, many countries operate within federal systems that mean that aspects of data policy, capability, availability, and use are shaped by sub-national governments. Indicators have been designed to accommodate this reality. In federal systems, researchers are able to provide a detailed assessment for a single sub-national context and indicate whether this is representative or not of other sub-national contexts.

### Universality

The highest scores in the Barometer are achieved when governance, capability, and availability can be shown to be *universal*—when everyone in the country is covered by, or protected by, governance rules; when everyone has access to capabilities or the development of capabilities; when everyone has access to meaningful data; and when data use has impact for the public good across the country.

### Bright spots design

The Barometer has adopted a *bright spots* design approach with the intention of collecting data on leading examples of good practice, even if the practice is not yet universal within a country. In the second edition, this design approach will focus on countries using data for the public good. This change will allow us to highlight the best practices in data use and highlight key lessons from different countries.

## The Barometer Structure 

The structure of the second edition of the Barometer was developed following intensive consultations with the research advisory committee and thematic partners. As highlighted above, this edition has new changes within the pillars, topic clusters, and cross-cutting themes. The following description offers a snapshot of how the study’s structure addresses all of these.

### Pillars

The Barometer is organised around three pillars or core areas of assessment \- governance, capability, and availability. To measure country performance, the GDB employs an expert survey that was developed in partnership with leading organizations in different fields and drawing on an open, participatory process in order to have meaningful depth while also being broadly comparable, ensuring consistent and comparable evaluations across different regions. This tool has been built upon results from its first edition to better speak to data practices and policies, but also to refine and strengthen our survey instrument. The data collection is conducted by a network of local researchers. This primary data is enriched with secondary data from existing sources, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate assessment.

### Action Areas and Thematic Clusters

For the second edition, we have adapted core and thematic areas to provide a comprehensive assessment of the data foundations necessary for a healthy data ecosystem. The Global Data Barometer's core action areas emphasize robust foundational frameworks, while also evaluating the capabilities and actions that support effective data production, storage, publication, and use. They are thematic clusters within a core topic that encompass multiple related indicators. These clusters focus on examining a specific topic from various angles, providing a comprehensive understanding of the issues. For example, the data governance foundations core action area includes data protection and data management while the governance for data use area covers frameworks that facilitate data flow, encompassing both open and non-open data sharing practices, which are addressed under governance for availability, data sharing, and open data policy.

To promote equitable access, frameworks must ensure that data is accessible and useful to all. This is addressed through action areas such as accessibility and multilingual support. Specific action areas focusing on capabilities include open data initiatives, civil service training, and government support for data reuse. Fig 2 below highlights the core action areas.

#### Thematic clusters

Thematic clusters further delve into specialized domains, providing a nuanced view of data foundations in critical areas. The Political Integrity cluster examines action areas such as political finance, right to information (RTI) performance, interest and asset declaration, and lobbying. The Land cluster focuses on land tenure and land use, highlighting the need for high quality data availability surrounding property and its use. The Company Information cluster investigates beneficial ownership and company registers, ensuring transparency in business operations. Finally, the Public Procurement and Public Finance clusters scrutinize public procurement processes and budget and spending practices, emphasizing the importance of data for public oversight. Fig 3\.  below presents the various action areas grouped under the thematic clusters. 

By addressing these action areas and thematic clusters, the GDB offers a detailed and holistic view of the current state of data foundations, offering new pathways to more effective and inclusive data ecosystems globally. Fostering healthier data ecosystems that protect democratic values, enhances transparency, and ensures a more informed and enlightened society.

### Cross-cutting Themes 

To provide a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of data foundations, the GDB incorporates cross-cutting themes throughout different aspects of the survey. Cross-cutting themes are included to exemplify the types of analysis and the wealth of information that the GDB will provide in this second edition. The cross-cutting themes include Inclusion, Use of data, and Artificial Intelligence.

#### Inclusion

Inclusion is a vital cross-cutting theme, focusing on gender and accessibility. This theme adds to the action areas and thematic clusters by addressing how inclusive data policies and practices are, considering the representation and participation of diverse groups, including women and individuals with disabilities. The GDB assesses whether data ensures that all segments of the population can access and benefit from data, thereby promoting equity and reducing disparities.

#### Use of Data

Use of Data includes sub-questions and primary indicators that assess how data is utilized and the support available for data re-use. This cross-cutting theme also incorporates a secondary use indicator from the first edition, Data Use by International Organizations, to assess broader patterns of data use. 

By integrating these cross-cutting themes and detailed sub-questions, the GDB can provide a richer and more insightful analysis of how data is being used, who is using it, and for what purposes. This comprehensive approach helps to highlight the practical impacts of data governance frameworks and identify areas for improvement to maximize the benefits of data within societies.

Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is examined through sub-questions related to the readiness and implementation of data for AI technologies. To the existing recurring sub-questions, aspects in secondary indicators, such as Digital government, from DGSS and new secondary indicators from sources such as the Global Index on Responsible AI (GIRAI) and other relevant frameworks are added to enhance the evaluation of AI readiness and implementation. By evaluating these aspects, the GDB provides insights into the progress and challenges of data foundations associated with AI deployment in different regions.

By providing a detailed and standardized assessment of these action areas, thematic clusters, and cross-cutting themes, the GDB offers a valuable tool for governments, policymakers, and stakeholders to understand and improve their data foundations. This, in turn, fosters more robust, inclusive, and transparent data ecosystems that can support sustainable development and innovation worldwide.

### Indicator Design

### Methodology Governance

#### Research Advisory Committee

One of the key accountability systems adopted by the Global Data Barometer is putting in place a Research Advisory Committee. The committee plays a crucial role in guiding and overseeing the research process and methodology. The committee has two main responsibilities; first, to hold the Global Data Bata Barometer to high standards of methodological rigour; and second, to strategically expand the GDB’s network.

#### Main Responsibilities of the Research Advisory Committee

**Reviewing Survey Components**

The committee is responsible for reviewing the proposed weighting of the various survey components and providing feedback. The committee members will conduct the review and offer feedback to hold the project accountable and strengthen its methodological stability.

**Overseeing Independent Peer Review**

The committee members serve as editors, coordinating the peer review process and assessing the revisions made. To do this effectively, the project will provide as much process scaffolding as possible for members.

The GDB methodology is governed by principles that ensure its robustness and reliability:

* Transparent Process: The entire methodology, including data sources and scoring criteria, is transparent and open for review.  
* Inclusive Participation: The methodology is developed and refined through consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, and civil society organisations.  
* Continuous Improvement: The methodology is regularly updated based on feedback and new developments in the field of data governance and management.

By adhering to these principles, the GDB aims to provide a reliable and comprehensive assessment of data governance practices around the world.
