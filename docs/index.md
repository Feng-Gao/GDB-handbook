## About the Barometer

Data is a source of power. It can be exploited for private gain, and used to limit freedom, or it can be deployed as a public good: a resource for tackling social challenges, enabling collaboration, driving innovation and improving accountability. The Global Data Barometerâ€™s goal is to fill critical knowledge gaps on how data policy and practice are unfolding in different sectors, regions, and countries around the world. The design of the Global Data Barometer responds to critical knowledge gaps in how policies and practices of governing, releasing and using data for the public good are unfolding across the globe.

Building on the Open Data Barometer study, which has been used to drive policymaking, advocacy, and academic research across the world, the Global Data Barometer asks: _To what extent are countries managing data for the public good?_

To answer this question we gather quantitative assessments and qualitative evidence questions, drawing on existing secondary datasets, and our own primary expert survey run through our network of global partners. 

The Barometer gathers both country-wide indicators, looking broadly at data governance, capabilities, availability and use and impact, and thematic indicators that focus on the state of data for public good in relation to specific areas of public policy. This combined breadth and depth approach is designed to:

*   Look at the overall environment for data for the public good in each country studied;
*   Explore how far assessments of the overall environment are also reflected in practice in particular thematic sectors;
*   Test the collection of indicator data that can be used by companion products to the overall Barometer index, maximising the re-use value of the data we collect.

This handbook contains only the draft primary indicators for our upcoming expert survey. A more complete list of indicators including proposed secondary data use will be released later in 2021.

## Indicator Development

Following the project design workshop in January 2020, and early pilot work in Summer 2020, we have explored an approach to indicator development that seeks to: 

*   **Generate indicator scores through the use of discrete elements.** This is a break from the Open Data Barometer scoring method that asked experts to provide a 0 - 10 score based on a rubrik, and responds both to a desire from partners for more structured, granular data, and to feedback that the previous scoring method led to unexplained variation between assessments. In this draft handbook under each indicator you will see the sub-questions that will be used to generate indicator scores. The exact calculation of scores is not included, and will be shared later in the year following further piloting and consultation. 
*   **Anchor indicators in established agreements and practices.** For the majority of indicators we have carried a review of the literature and of international standards and agreements to ensure that indicators assess countries against reasonable benchmarks that are rooted in prior international agreements or commitments. In particular, we draw on the Sustainable Development Goals as international agreement on public goods. 
*  **Identify bright spots and recognise different systems of government.** In particular, we have sought to increase the sensitivity of indicators to federal systems, and to cases where good practice may exist at an agency or sub-national level, even if the practice is not yet widespread. We have also sought to avoid cultural or high-income country biases in the design of indicators through look for examples and evidence from a wide range of settings. However, during this consultation phase we particularly welcome feedback to ensure indicators are framed to provide fair assessment across all country contexts.  
*   **Generate actionable data.** For a number of themes, we have worked with partners to understand how they might use primary data from the Global Data Barometer, and to ensure data points can support improved government practice.

## Theme Selection

On the [themes](themes/) page you can find a list of the different modules that our expert survey researchers will be asked to provide data on. These modules collect together related indicators that we anticipate researchers will address together. Modules vary in scale, although the influence of thematic modules on the overall Barometer score will be balanced through weighted aggregation. 

The governance and capability modules provide a country-wide assessment of the environment supporting data for the public good. The availability and use components of the overall Barometer are measured primarily through thematic modules. 

The overall selection of thematic modules has been based on achieving coverage of a range of functions of government, and a range of sustainable development goals, as well as responding to partnership opportunities to develop in depth thematic assessments. 

We were able to secure partnerships to allow development of six expanded modules:

* Company Information - developed with Open Ownership 
* Health and Covid-19 (developed with input from the Open Data Charter / D4D) 
* Land - developed with Land Portal  
* Political Integrity- developed with OGP and TI 
* Public Finance - developed with GIFT 
* Procurement - developed with OCP 

In recognition of the importance of the topic, we also carried out a more comprehensive development process for our module on Climate Action, including producing a full background paper for consultation. 

To complete the spread of thematic areas addressed in the pilot edition of the Global Data Barometer, to respond to demand from our research network, and to provide continuity with the Open Data Barometer where possible, we have also included availability indicators for the following themes in our primary survey: 

* Crime and Justice;
* Energy Data; 
* Geospatial Data;
* Migration;
* Transportation.

We have also identified secondary sources for availability indicators on education and agriculture. 

## Handbook Structure

This Handbook contains:

* [General researcher guidance](/guidance/);
* **[Primary Indicators](/indicators/)** for inclusion in the project's expert survey;
* [Theme discussion notes](/themes/) providing background on each of the thematic focus areas in the Barometer.
## Share your comments and annotations

For us, the public review process will help improve the approach we are taking. We want to provide the opportunity to our thematic partners, regional hubs, prospective partners, and other stakeholders working in the field of data for public good, to: 

* Support the validation of the primary indicators for the pilot edition of the Barometer;
* Bring in perspectives, experiences and expertise and thus, be part of the co-creation process around the Global Data Barometer methodology longer-term; 
* Help identify missing elements or refine aspects which are not straightforward in the handbook; 
* Provide any additional insight into the expected level of effort national researchers will undertake for the data collection phase and how we can best address some of the limitations in this regard. 

This version of the handbook has been published in advance of our expert survey to invite feedback on our proposed indicators.

Please take time to look at the proposed indicators, and let us know if there are ways these could be improved to provide clearer definitions, respond to different global contexts, or to address important issues we may have missed.

We welcome both positive and critical feedback. You can share feedback as [annotations](annotate.md), or using the feedback form on each indicator.

## Project Milestones

The Global Data Barometer pilot has been in active development since late 2019, with an anchor grant from IDRC since July 2020. The pilot project timeline has been updated to reflect disruptions created by the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

* May 2019 - Initial idea of the Global Data Barometer discussed at the OGP Global Summit;
* November/December 2019 - Background research with key stakeholders to gather user requirements for the new study;
* January 2020 - Design workshop bringing together key partners in Washington DC to develop conceptual model for the new study  ([workshop report](https://globaldatabarometer.org/2020/01/reporting-back-on-our-first-design-workshop/));
* July 2020 - Main grant for project development approved and core team began developing partnerships, indicators and research tools;
* April 2021 - Consultation on primary research questions [Current phase]
* Late May 2021 - Primary data collection process begins
* June 2021 - Finalisation of index structure including secondary data
* October 2021 - Global Report, and support to creation of thematic reports
