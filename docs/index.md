You are viewing the **draft** Global Data Barometer Research Handbook (2021).

This Handbook contains:

* [General researcher guidance](/guidance/);
* **[Primary Indicators](/indicators/)** for inclusion in the project's expert survey;
* [Theme discussion notes](/themes/) providing background on each of the thematic focus areas in the Barometer.

It does not currently include:

* Full details of **secondary indicators** that will be included in the Barometer;
* The proposed structure of the index, and details of indicator scoring and aggregation;
* Finalised researcher or reviewer guidance.

!!! note "We want your feedback"

	This version of the handbook has been published in advance of our expert survey to invite feedback on our proposed indicators.

	Please take time to look at the proposed indicators, and let us know if there are ways these could be improved to provide clearer definitions, respond to different global contexts, or to address important issues we may have missed. 

	We welcome both positive and critical feedback. You can share feedback as [annotations](annotate), or using the feedback form on each indicator.
