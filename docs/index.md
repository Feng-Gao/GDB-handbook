You are viewing the draft Global Data Barometer Research Handbook (2021).
## Introduction

Data is a source of power. It can be exploited for private gain and used to limit freedom, or it can be deployed as a public good - a resource for tackling social challenges, enabling collaboration, driving innovation, and improving accountability. 

The goal of the Global Data Barometer is to fill critical knowledge gaps on how the use of data is evolving across different sectors, regions, and countries around the world. The design of the Global Data Barometer (GDB) specifically seeks to address critical knowledge gaps related to how the policies and practices of governing, releasing, and using data for the public good are unfolding across the globe.

Building on the [Open Data Barometer study](https://www.opendatabarometer.org), which has been used to drive policymaking, advocacy, and academic research around the world, the Global Data Barometer asks the question: _**To what extent are countries managing data for the public good?**_

To answer this question, the GDB will incorporate both quantitative and qualitative assessments, drawing on primary data collected through an expert survey to be implemented by a network of global partners, as well as data to be drawn from existing secondary sources.

Primary data collection is structured around a selection of country-wide indicators which seek to measure progress in terms of data governance, capabilities, availability, use, and impact. In addition, specific thematic indicators will focus on the state of data for public good in relation to specific sectors or areas of public policy. This combined breadth and depth approach is designed to:

* Review and assess the overall environment for data for the public good in each country studied;
* Explore whether assessments of the overall environment reflect existing data practices in particular thematic sectors;
* Ensure the collection of indicator data supports reuse in ‘companion’ products developed by project partners and maximises the potential reuse value of the data we collect within the broader research and policy community.

This handbook contains only the draft primary indicators for our upcoming expert survey. A more complete list of indicators, including proposed secondary data sources will be released later in 2021.

## 2021 Pilot Edition

This 2021 Edition of the Global Data Barometer is being approached as a pilot in order to explore:

* Expanding beyond the limited open data focus of past indicators to examine data more broadly for the public good;
* New indicator designs and research guidance;
* New partnership models for developing and using thematic indicator data;
* Completing the field work through a network of regional hubs in order to benefit from localised expertise.

Lessons learned as a result of this pilot edition will be applied directly to future editions of the Barometer.
## Indicator Development

Following the project design workshop in January 2020, and early pilot work in Summer 2020, we have explored an approach to indicator development that seeks to: 

*   **Generate indicator scores through the use of discrete elements.** This is a change from the Open Data Barometer scoring method that asked experts to provide a 0 - 10 score, and responds both to a desire from partners for more structured, granular data, and to past feedback that the previous scoring method led to unexplained variation between assessments. In the GDB Handbook, you will see the sub-questions under each indicator used to generate indicator scores. The exact calculation of scores is not included, but will be shared later in the year following further piloting and consultation.
*   **Anchor indicators in established agreements and practices.**  For the majority of indicators, a review of the literature, international standards, and agreements has been completed to ensure that indicators assess countries against reasonable benchmarks that are rooted in applicable international agreements or commitments. In particular, we draw on the Sustainable Development Goals as the basis for international agreement on public goods.
*  **Identify bright spots and recognise different systems of government.** In particular, we have sought to increase the sensitivity of indicators to federal systems and to cases where good practices may exist at an agency or sub-national level, even if the practice is not yet widespread. We have also sought to avoid cultural or high-income country biases in the design of indicators by utilising examples and evidence from a wider range of settings. However, during this consultation phase, specific feedback is sought to ensure indicators provide a fair assessment across all country contexts.
*   **Generate actionable data.** For a number of themes, we have worked with partners to understand how they might use the primary data generated by the Global Data Barometer, as well as how that data can support improved government practice.

The [indicators page](indicators/) contains a full list of survey indicators under consideration for inclusion in the 2021 Pilot edition of the GDB. Certain themes and selected indicator sub-questions have been selected to build upon past editions of the Open Data Barometer to provide continuity with the former study’s metrics, including assessing the presence of open data frameworks, initiatives, and datasets. In some cases, we have identified new secondary sources to replace primary Open Data Barometer questions, so not all Open Data Barometer data categories are necessarily reflected in the GDB handbook. 

## Theme and Module Selection

The overall structure of the Barometer was developed following a [participatory design workshop](https://globaldatabarometer.org/2020/01/reporting-back-on-our-first-design-workshop/), which identified four components, a range of potential themes, and a number of cross-cutting issues to be used in structuring the study. 

On the [themes page](themes/), you will find a full list of the topics to be covered in the Pilot Edition of the GDB and for which researchers will be asked to provide primary data. These include the core components of the Barometer, thematic modules that contain multiple related indicators, and short modules that will add one or two additional availability questions to the primary survey. These themes will be used to structure the survey that is presented to researchers, and to support thematic analysis of the results. Although themes vary in size, their influence on the overall Barometer score will be balanced through weights applied during index calculation. 

### Components
Governance and Capability are core components of the Barometer, and contain primary indicators designed to provide a country-wide assessment of existing data ecosystems. These will be complemented by additional indicators on governance and capability from thematic modules. The Availability and Use components of the Barometer are assessed primarily through primary metrics from other thematic modules.
Thematic modules

The overall selection of thematic modules for this pilot edition is based on the desire to cover a range of government functions, a range of sustainable development goals, as well as to benefit from the expertise of partners who are contributing to in-depth thematic assessments. Currently, a range of GDB partners are contributing to the development of the following thematic modules:

* **[Climate Action](themes/Climate Action.md)** - developed with the [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/)
* **[Company Information](themes/Company Information.md)** - developed with [Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/)
* **[Health](themes/Health.md)** & **[COVID-19](themes/COVID-19.md)** - developed with input from the [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/) / [D4D](https://www.d4d.net/)
* **[Land](themes/Land.md)** - developed with the [Land Portal](https://www.landportal.org)
* **[Political Integrity](themes/Political Integrity.md)** - developed with [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en) and the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
* **Public Finance** - developed with the [Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency](http://www.fiscaltransparency.net/)
* **[Procurement](themes/Procurement.md)** - developed with [the Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org)
 
### Short modules
In addition to these thematic modules, the GDB contains indicators for several more themes in order to serve the broader data research network and provide continuity with the past editions of the Open Data Barometer:

* [Crime and Justice](themes/Crime and Justice.md)
* [Energy Data](themes/Energy.md)
* [Geospatial](themes/Geospatial.md)
* [Population](themes/Population Data.md)
* [Transportation](themes/Transportation.md)

We have also identified secondary sources for availability indicators on education and agriculture.

### Cross-cutting issues

The design of indicators has also taken into account the goal of providing insight into a number of cross-cutting issues, including the development of artificial intelligence, and state of data as a tool of sustainable development, and issues of inclusion, diversity and gender. These cross-cutting concerns are reflected in the choice of indicators and in the sub-questions they contain (for example, looking for evidence that AI has been considered in data governance arrangements, focussing on datasets with particular sustainable development applications, or addressing inclusion focussed uses of data). We have published a  discussion document covering our exploration of gender and inclusion, and are working to provide further detail on how our indicators can be used for analysis of these cross-cutting issues. 

## Share your comments and annotations

This version of the handbook has been published in advance of our expert survey to invite feedback on the proposed indicators for the GDB Pilot Edition. The public review process is designed to improve the assessment methodology, as well as the overall approach of the GDB. 

Please review any or all aspects of the handbook and indicate any improvement that could be made to provide clearer definitions, improve indicators, respond to different global contexts, or address important issues that may have been missed. Key objectives of the review include:

* Support the validation of the primary indicators for the pilot edition of the Barometer;
* Bring in perspectives, experiences, and expertise to support a ‘co-creation’ process around the Global Data Barometer methodology;
* Help identify missing elements or refine aspects which are not clear in the handbook;
* Provide any additional insight into the expected level of effort required by national researchers to complete the data collection phase.

We welcome both positive and critical feedback. You can share feedback as [annotations](annotate.md), or using the feedback form on each indicator.
