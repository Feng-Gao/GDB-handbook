# Theme overview

**Key links:** HubSpot Deal | Consultation

Natural resources are a public asset to be managed for the public good in ways that support sustainable development. 

Data can be used to monitor extractives licenses, track extractives revenues, and support environmental monitoring of extractives projects.

We are considering inclusion of an extractives theme, but have not yet carried out outreach to recruit a partner for this. 

If we do not have a partner for this theme, we are unlikely to include extractives as a specific theme in 2021. 

We have had contact with NRGI who are interested in a possible extractives theme. Open Ownership will also have a large extractives focus in 2021 onwards. We should consider a light touch on extractives in 2020, with view to more in 2021.
