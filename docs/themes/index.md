# Themes

We have organised development of indicators for the Global Data Barometer into thematic modules. These modules collect together related indicators that we anticipate researchers will address together. Modules vary in scale, although the influence of thematic modules on the overall Barometer score will be balanced through weighted aggregation. 

The governance and capability modules provide a country-wide assessment of the environment supporting data for the public good. 

* **[Data Governance](Governance.md)**  
* **[Capabilities](Capabilities.md)** 

The availability and use components of the overall Barometer are measured primarily through thematic modules, which also provide additional some additional governance and capability indicators. The overall selection of thematic modules has been based on achieving coverage of a range of functions of government, and a range of sustainable development goals, as well as responding to partnership opportunities to develop in depth thematic assessments. 

The following larger modules have been developed with partners, and/or are supported by detailed background notes:

* **[Political Integrity](Political Integrity.md)** - developed with [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en) and the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
* **[Company Information](Company Information.md)** - developed with [Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/)
* **[Procurement](Procurement.md)** - developed with [the Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org)
* **[Land](Land.md)** - developed with [Land Portal](https://www.landportal.org)
* **Public Finance** - under development with GIFT (to be posted by April 30th)
* **[Climate Action](Climate Action.md)**
* **[Health](Health.md)** & **[COVID-19](COVID-19.md)** - developed with input from the [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/) / [D4D](https://www.d4d.net/)


To complete the spread of thematic areas addressed in the pilot edition of the Global Data Barometer, to respond to demand from our research network, and to provide continuity with the Open Data Barometer where possible, the Barometer will also include availability indicators for the following themes in our primary survey. You will find brief notes on the reasons for including these themes, and their scope, in the pages below. However, full development documents have not been prepared for these.  

* [Crime and Justice](Crime and Justice.md)
* [Energy Data](Energy.md)
* [Geospatial](Geospatial.md)
* [Population Data](Population Data.md)
* [Transportation](Transportation.md)

!!! note "Share your feedback"

    The list of themes for the pilot edition of the Global Data Barometer is now in final draft status, and is unlikely to significantly change. At this point we welcome feedback on: 
    
    * **The proposed indicators** under each theme. 
    * **The details of each indicator**
    * **Theme justifications** and in particular, any regional considerations relevant to thse
    * **Potential use cases** for the primary data that will be gathered for particular themes

    In particular, we are keen to hear from stakeholders who may make use of data gathered under a particular theme, and to identify if there are ways we can ensure the primary data collection carried out best meets stakeholder needs.
