# Thematic modules

Data policies and practices are transforming almost every aspect of modern life. The Global Data Barometer explores data in context through a number of thematic modules, looking at the connection between specific data governance, availability and use practices.

Each theme has been selected and developed based on:

* **Potential uses of data for the public good** - drawing on the Sustainable Development Goals to explore how thematic data may be governed and used to support development and public good;
* **Demand for metrics** - working with partners to understand the use cases for global indicators on data governance, availability or use;
* **Contributions to a rounded picture of national data landscapes** - including maintaining continuity where possible to the data categories assessed in the Open Data Barometer.

For the pilot edition of the Global Data Barometer, we have developed a number of in-depth thematic or cross-cutting modules, carrying out a development process with partners to understand key data needs, design prospective indicators, and anchor Barometer metrics in existing literature and international agreements. A number of these modules are supported by detailed background papers or notes that illustrate the considerations driving indicator design. 

Below you can access the justification for inclusion of each module, along with the proposed primary indicators. Note: modules may also draw on secondary data which is not listed here. 

* **[Political Integrity](Political Integrity.md)** - developed with [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en) and the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
* **[Company Information](Company Information.md)** - developed with [Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/)
* **[Procurement](Procurement.md)** - developed with [the Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org)
* **[Land](Land.md)** - developed with [Land Portal](https://www.landportal.org)
* **Public Finance** - under development with GIFT (to be posted by April 30th)
* **[Climate Action](Climate Action.md)**
* **[Health](Health.md)** & **[COVID-19](COVID-19.md)** - developed with input from the [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/) / [D4D](https://www.d4d.net/)
* **[Data Governance](Governance.md)** - developed as a cross-cutting module. 

Additionally, we are proposing to include selected indicators on the following themes, primarily for continuity with the Open Data Barometer and to ensure a broad range of themes are covered by the Barometer:

* [Energy Data](Energy.md)
* [Geospatial](Geospatial.md)
* [Transportation](Transportation.md)
* [Crime and Justice](Crime and Justice.md)
* [Agriculture](Agriculture.md) (Secondary data only)
* [Education](Education.md) (Secondary data only)

!!! note "Share your feedback"

    The list of themes for the pilot edition of the Global Data Barometer is now in final draft status, and is unlikely to significantly change. At this point we welcome feedback on: 
    
    * **The proposed indicators** under each theme. 
    * **The details of each indicator**
    * **Theme justifications** and in particular, any regional considerations relevant to thse
    * **Potential use cases** for the primary data that will be gathered for particular themes

    In particular, we are keen to hear from stakeholders who may make use of data gathered under a particular theme, and to identify if there are ways we can ensure the primary data collection carried out best meets stakeholder needs.
