## Introduction

International migrants compose 3.5% of the world’s population. One of the most important progresses made in the field of migration data globally, has been the acknowledgment that more migration statistics need to be produced. Thus, the Global Compact for Migration, which is a global commitment on improving international cooperation on migration, as well as on the collection of migration data, highlights the importance of having a better understanding of the trends and evolving patterns and processes, in order to support the development of evidence-based responses.

At the same time, however, in order to understand and produce migration statistics, one needs to enhance not only the capacity of the data producers on how to properly produce the data and respond to the emerging demands for data, but of the whole statistical architecture and ecosystem which requires significant improvements and upgrades. It does also require investments in human capacity building.

Currently, information which is scattered around different administrative data systems, has to be put together in order to create a complete picture of migration phenomena. For example, in Asia-Pacific region, four out of 53 countries are able to provide any type of data related to migration flows. These are Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia.” (Raymer 2020). Which is why, a better understanding of migration data will lead towards the establishment of better coordination mechanisms at the country level in order to allow all the data to be integrated together and later delivered effectively to the data users.

Relevant, high quality migration data is critical for designing, implementing, and evaluating public policies that are able to generate substantial longer-term economic, social, and humanitarian benefits for countries and migrants alike.

## Prospective indicators

Migration will primarily be addressed through elements included in other indicators. We are not currently able to display element-by-element in the handbook. We are also considering the following indicators:

## Migration and the public good

Our approach to the public good is rooted in respect for universal human rights, including the rights of migrants, and an inclusive approach to policy.

Data for the public good in the migration sector should contribute to improved national and international migration policies, with data creating more good impacts for the migrants themselves, while public, private, civil society and international institutions having the means to inform emergency response.

Our focus on migration data aligns with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which recognizes for the first time the contribution of migration to sustainable development. Migration is a cross-cutting issue, relevant to all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 10 out of 17 goals contain targets and indicators that are relevant to migration or mobility, according to the www.migrationdataportal.org. The Agenda's core principle to "leave no one behind", including migrants, requires data disaggregation by migratory status, opening up significant migration data needs but also the opportunity to improve migration data.

SDG Target 10.7 calls on states to *“facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people”*. Both traditional and new data sources can play an important role in supporting policy and humanitarian responses to migration. Migrant communities can be particularly vulnerable to data abuses, and new sources of data need to be well governed to respect privacy.

Objective 1 of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, expresses the collective commitment of the member states towards collecting and utilizing accurate and disaggregated data as a basis for evidence based policies,  with specific actions ensuring improvement of migration data: “migration data collection, analysis and dissemination is accurate, reliable, comparable, disaggregated by sex, age, migration status and other characteristics relevant in national contexts, while upholding the right to privacy under international human rights law and protecting personal data.” Accordingly, we are rooting our assessment in the Global Compact, and will be tracking, to the extent possible, how far countries are progressing on this over time

## Global relevance of migration data

There were almost 80 million forcibly displaced people across the world at the end of 2019, and 26 million refugees. International migrants compose 3.5% of the world’s population. The Sustainable Development Goals core principle to “leave no-one behind” includes migrants, and can require data disaggregation by migration status.

SDG Target 10.7 calls on states to “facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people” and both traditional and new data sources can play an important role in supporting policy and humanitarian responses to migration. Migrant communities can be particularly vulnerable to data abuses, and new sources of data need to be well governed to respect privacy.

In all parts of the world, countries have been strengthening their migration “systems.” Such systems refer to States’: legislative base; national structures and personnel (i.e., technical capacities); cooperation within ministries and between countries; and with other stakeholders including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations such as IOM, ILO and UNHCR and regional bodies. Understanding what data is available across governments to support cooperation among various stakeholders, and ultimately influence the policies in the field is key. At the same time, in the context of Migration for Development agenda, Governments have been aiming to get a better understanding of the data around the migration phases and be able to intervene accordingly to support their citizens both in the countries of origin as well as in the destination countries: i.e. pre-migration, during migration, reintegration.

One of the most important progresses made in the field of migration data globally, is around acknowledging that more migration statistics need to be produced. Thus, the Global Compact for Migration, which is a global commitment on improving international cooperation on migration, as well as on the collection of migration data, highlights the importance of having a better understanding of the trends and evolving patterns and processes, in order to support the development of evidence-based responses.

At the same time, however, in order to understand and produce migration statistics, one needs to enhance not only the capacity of the data producers on how to properly produce the data and respond to the emerging demands for data, but of the whole statistical architecture and ecosystem which requires significant improvements and upgrades. It does also require investments in human capacity building.

Currently, information which is now scattered around different administrative data systems, has to be put together in order to create a complete picture of migration phenomena. For example, in Asia-Pacific region, four out of 53 countries are able to provide any type of data related to migration flows. These are Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia.” (Raymer 2020). Which is why, a better understanding of migration data will lead towards the establishment of better coordination mechanisms at the country level in order to allow all the data to be integrated together and later delivered effectively to the data users.

One of the underlying questions this module might aim to address is whether or not we expect to have to approach migration data differently in different countries and regions and whether migration is a similarly significant issue for all countries included in the Global Data Barometer. Countries vary in terms of having net migration inflows or outflows, however, all countries experience some form of migration, which is why it is key to understand it through our indicators that cover both inflow and outflow. At the same time, countries are all expected to have well integrated administrative systems that would be able to capture migration-relevant data. We know that few have this integrated well and a lot of improvements are still on the way. Additionally, political sensitivities of migration vary across countries and regions - so the risks and appropriateness of open publication of data might vary and this is something to be analysed with the support of GDB regional hubs, which might be able to bring regional perspectives into data collection, analysis and dissemination.

## Module development notes

An initial literature review was carried out for development of this module, but we were not able to secure a funding partner, and so this has not been prepared for publication. The draft can be shared on request.
