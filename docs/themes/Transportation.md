## Introduction

Mobility allows people to access employment and culture, to keep in touch with family, and engage in exchange of ideas. Transportation enables trade in goods within and between countries. Yet the transport sector also accounts for up to 14% of annual climate change emissions.

Data can support access to public transit and the development of new smart transport solutions. Data can be used to promote greater gender equality in the planning and operation of transport networks. 

This module is included for continuity with the Open Data Barometer category on public transport timetables, and to recognise the significance of the transportation sector. It also provides an opportunity to look at regulation of data sharing by private actors, and to examine real-time data sources.
