A sustainable, resilient agriculture sector is vital to achieving good nutrition and zero-hunger worldwide (SDG 2). 

Governments and private actors need many sources of data to make good agricultural decisions. Small-scale farmers need to have confidence that their farm data is not used against their interests. And consumers can benefit from data about the safety and nutrition of the food they eat. 

## Proposed Indicators

In the 2021 Pilot Edition of the Global Data Barometer we plan to address agriculture data through using secondary indicators drawn from the [Open Data Inventory](https://odin.opendatawatch.com/), and will not be including a primary indicator.
