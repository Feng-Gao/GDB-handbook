# Theme overview

**Key links:** HubSpot Deal | Consultation

Individuals and businesses need information about local areas to make decisions and shape their plans. 

Often there is a gap between the data capability and availability nationally, and locally. Having local data and local capacity to use it, can be vital to harnessing the potential of data as a tool for economic development, local participation and vibrant cultural life.

> Last night I had a talk with CoE colleagues working on Local Government in EaP. They are interested in bringing more local governments into the Local Open Gov program in OGP and will be supporting the selected ones in various ways. We might want to explore further the CoE commitment for local gov, including from the perspective of the data (we have still a limited engagement at the local level when it comes to open data).
