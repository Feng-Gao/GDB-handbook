## Introduction

Health research, public health work, and provision of primary healthcare all draw substantially upon data. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of reliable, accessible and trusted health data to enable coordinated action.
The governance and re-usability of data in the health sector must combine respect for individual privacy rights, with a focus on population and patient health. Data can be used to support access to healthcare across the many different healthcare systems of the world. 

This module is included in the 2021 Barometer for continuity with the Open Data Barometer's metric on the availability of health data, the importance of health data, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We have identified that secondary data from the [Open Data Inventory](https://odin.opendatawatch.com/) can be used to provide continuity with the Open Data Barometer health indicators.
