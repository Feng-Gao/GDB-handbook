## Introduction

Government and private sector investment in infrastructure can power economic development. Infrastructure should be developed in consultation with the public, with respect for the environment, and with transparency around public finance.

Data on infrastructure project planning and execution can be used to improve quality, manage risks, and improve citizen participation.

## Status

We carried out scoping to include this theme in the pilot edition of the Global Data Barometer, but were not able to secure resources to cover primary data collection.
