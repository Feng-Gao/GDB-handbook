# Theme overview

**Key links:** HubSpot Deal | Consultation

Over 55% of the worlds population live in cities. Visions of future cities often focus on the idea of data-driven smart cities. 

Availability and accessibility of data to city-dwellers is vital to allow oversight, control and autonomy in the data-rich city. 

Building on debates around the **open city** this module will provide an opportunity to interrogate the governance of city-level data.

# Rough  notes

Veronica had a call with UN Habitat on September 29, they are interested to collaborate with GDB. The least they can provide is expertise in scoping the module, indicators. They are also open to engage in fundraising for this thematic module. There was another idea they proposed and that is us partnering on a potential Global City Barometer (smth that could be done at the level of capital cities but also bringing on board regional capitals or 2-3 biggest cities per country).
