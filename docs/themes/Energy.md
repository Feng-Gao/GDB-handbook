## Introduction

Creation and use of data relies upon access to, and reliability of, energy supplies. Meeting the sustainable development goals requires a clean energy transition.

Data can be used to shape energy markets: supporting public and private sector to plan grids and micro-grids, and to innovate in provision of clean energy and creation of smart grids. Data governance is needed to protect consumer data. 

We are including a short-module on Energy Data in the 2021 Global Data Barometer in response to partner demand, with an emphasis on the importance of this data in low and middle income countries.

## Module development notes

The development of this module has drawn upon the [Open Up Guide on Climate Action](https://open-data-charter.gitbook.io/open-up-guide-using-open-data-to-advance-climate-a/relevant-data-types), and has paid particular attention to gendered dimensions of energy access.
