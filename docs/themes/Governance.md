## Introduction

Governance is one of the four components of the Global Data Barometer. 

Effective governance of data for the public good involves having rules, processes and structures in place that make sure that data is reliable, trustworthy and comprehensive. These should also make sure that sensitive data is protected, while non-personal datasets are shared or opened for re-use. 

This section includes a number of country-level data governance indicators on the presence of regulatory regimes for **data protection**, **right to information**, and **right to data**, as well as identifying emerging frameworks for **data sharing.** 

In addition, we have thematic governance indicators across the different sectoral themes covered in the Barometer. These thematic indicators will explore the extent to which the collection, sharing and secure management of specific datasets is placed on a strong footing through law, regulation, policy and guidance.
