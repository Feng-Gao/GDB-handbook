## Introduction

Mapping and location data are an important foundation for many applications.

Providing open geodata can support civic action and economic development. Effective data governance should be in place to protect against abuse of location data about individuals. 

This theme is included for continuity with the Open Data Barometer which assessed the openness of national map datasets. A number of other themes (e.g. land ownership) will touch upon geodata, when we identify features of other thematic datasets.
