## Introduction

Capability is one of the four components of the Global Data Barometer.

Having data available, and having the right rules in place to govern data, will not lead to significant public good if a country lacks the capability to create, manage and use data effectively. Capabilities involve having the full opportunity to do something of value: taking into account issues of access, skills, infrastructure, institutions and intermediaries. We also draw upon [Gurstein's notion of effective access](https://firstmonday.org/article/view/1107/1027).

Many of the capability indicators for the Barometer will be drawn from secondary data, although we will include a small number of primary indicators to:

- Maintain continuity with the Open Data Barometer
- Pilot approaches to capturing capability data through the Global Data Barometer
- Address specific capability questions in relation to thematic modules
