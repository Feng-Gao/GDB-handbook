## Justification

## Definitions and Identification

A national company register should contain details of companies that are incorporated within that country. For the purpose of this indicator, focus on **limited liability companies** or equivalent. 

This indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:

- Company registration is collected and maintained as **structured data** across the whole country
- Company registration contains structured data on **directors** and **shareholders**
- Company information should be **regularly updated**
- Detailed company information should be **published**

The most robust form of framework will have the force of law and will provide for comprehensive and regularly updated data. 
****

If there are multiple forms of limited liability company in this country operating under different frameworks, you should **focus your assessment on the most common domestic form**, as identified in the [World Bank's Doing Business report](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/). 

If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other common forms of company, please briefly comment on this in the free text justification.

## Research guidance

### Starting points

- **Sources:**
    - The [World Bank Doing Business Law Library](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/law-library) contains references to **Commercial and Company Laws** for many countries. [Note: some links are outdated, and you may need to use [archive.org](http://archive.org) to retrieve documents].
    - The [World Bank Doing Business Economy Snapshots](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data) contain a description of the process of forming a company which will usually indicate the relevant registration authority.
- **Search:**
    - For recent updates to company registration laws in the country.
    - The website of the company registration agency for details of how they collect and manage data, and the basis of this in law or regulation.
    - For examples of current forms used to register a company.
- **Consult:**
    - People who have recently formed a company may be able to describe the process
    - Company registration agents

### What to look for?

Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:

- Is the framework for company registration and disclosure of company information provided for **in law,** through **regulation** or through **policy**.
- Does the framework require company registration to be entered into a database? Or does it, for example, only require issuance of a certificate?
- Does the framework require this information to be managed as structured data?
- Does the framework specify that information should be updated regularly? Or does it only require submission of data when a company is first registered?
- If data from the company register is publicly available, is this on a legal basis? Or could government choose to remove access to the data at any time?

### National and sub-national considerations

In some countries company registration is a **sub-national responsibility,** carried out by individual states, regions or cities.

This indicator is concerned with whether there is a framework that will support access to data about **all companies** in a country. This might be achieved by:

- Having a minimum set of practices and standards that lead to data collection across all sub-national units; and
- A framework that provides for aggregation of data from different sub-national units into a national database.

To assess countries where company registration is organised sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice. 

Researchers should comment on whether any framework exists to aggregate data from sub-national registers, or to provide this in interoperable formats.
