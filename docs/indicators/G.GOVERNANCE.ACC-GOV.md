    The accessibility coverage of the data *collection* process affects how easily a person can provide data, with consequences for meaningful compliance and data quality. 
    
    Similarly, the accessibility coverage of the formats in which data and its explanatory materials are *published* will affect who can use that data and how.
    
    In some countries, accessibility coverage is mandated by a separate law that applies more broadly to government communications; in those instances, please note the relevant law in the space provided and briefly explain how it applies.
