# Availability: Vulnerability

The survey asks the question: To what extent is climate vulnerability information available as open data? 

{% include "feedback.md" %}


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Information about climate vulnerability should include granular local data and be available in user-friendly outputs; any projections should draw on transparent, open models. Datasets should speak to the two major strands of vulnerability approaches: the **risks and hazards** approach, which focuses on responding to natural hazards and extreme weather events; and the **entitlements and livelihoods** approach, which focuses on preventing undesirable outcomes by identifying where people have too few resources to withstand or recover from disaster; for example, in conjunction with poverty, gender, and marginalization. Further, to support collaborative data collection work across actors, the data repository should have a mechanism to support contributions from additional actors.
    
    Examples of relevant vulnerability data* include but are not limited to:
    
    - Data on urban water quality, access, and scarcity;
    - Data on the use of agricultural practices and crop varieties that are resistant to
    
        extreme temperatures, rains, and pests;
    
    - Data on population access to early warning systems for disease vectors and extreme
    
        weather events;
    
    - Data on the scope of coastal protection or rollback programs;
    - Demographic data, including sex-disaggregated data on livelihoods, access to public services, etc.;
    - Population and infrastructure density in risk-prone areas (e.g., areas vulnerable to
    
        storm surges or landslides).
    
    *Drawn from the [Open Up Guide: Using Open Data To Advance Climate Action](https://open-data-charter.gitbook.io/open-up-guide-using-open-data-to-advance-climate-a/relevant-data-types).
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible for individuals to use climate vulnerability data to easily and accurately assess the climate vulnerability of their neighborhood, the neighborhoods of their loved ones, and neighborhoods they might consider for relocation; to identify specific needs for adaptation tools and services; and to propose and track government responses. 
    
    In some countries, governments may rely on proprietary sources to generate some or all of their climate vulnerability data; alternatively, in some countries, the available climate vulnerability data may draw from government-generated data (e.g., meteorological data, poverty data) but be published by organizations or businesses, either openly or in proprietary forms. If either case applies to your country, please be sure to explain in the answer boxes.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The [Open DRI Index](https://index.opendri.org/) can be useful for locating relevant source data that a country draws from as part of its climate vulnerability data, identifying where the country makes such information available, and, particularly, evaluating whether source data is open, restricted, or closed.
    
    - **Search:**
        - Websites of the ministry of environment, office of climate action, disaster management, foresight, etc.
        - Websites of organizations or businesses that offer climate vulnerability data specific to your country.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Officials in your national or local environmental, disaster management, or foresight office.
        - Scholars or researchers at civil society organizations who research climate vulnerability, resilience, or disaster management in your country.
        - Officers at civil society organizations who work on implementing adaptation or resilience projects in communities vulnerable to climate change.
        - Journalists who report on climate change, disaster management, vulnerable communities, or inequitable access to climate change–related resources.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does the data contain information not only on vulnerability to hazards, but also vulnerability to undesirable outcomes? On both ecological effects as well as societal effects, particularly on populations with less access to resources?
    - Does the data include sufficient granularity to make it an effective tool for local actors to plan actions in the present and future? Or is it primarily large-scale, drawing on satellite data that has not been informed by on-the-ground knowledge?
    - Are the models that projections rely on made available to the people using the climate vulnerability data? Are they sufficiently open and transparent for an external actor to assess their validity?
    - Is the data made available in user-friendly outputs that don't require high levels of technical skills to understand or access? For example, an agency might make vulnerability data available as layered maps.
    - If you wanted to contribute data, is there a clear means for you to do so?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, data about climate vulnerability may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where data about climate vulnerability is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Understanding climate vulnerability is critical to empowering and supporting climate actors and decision-makers, particularly with regard to adaptation. Consequently, the UNFCCC encourages all parties—and requires Annex 1 countries—to report on actions related to vulnerability assessments. The IPCC defines vulnerability as “The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt” (WGII AR5 Annex II). The Sendai Framework, calls for disaster risk management that’s grounded in a comprehensive understanding of disaster risk “in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics and the environment” (23) and specifically directs governments at national and local levels to “promote the collection, analysis, management and use of relevant data and practical information and ensure its dissemination, taking into account the needs of different categories of users, as appropriate” (24(b)).
