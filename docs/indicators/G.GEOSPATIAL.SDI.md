# Governance: Spatial Data Infrastructure

The survey asks the question: To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies and guidance provide an integrated framework to maximise safe access to, and use of, geospatial data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    To take the best of geospatial information and contribute to sustainable development it is recommended that countries have an integrated approach that maximise, for a wide range of stakeholders, safe access to and use of geospatial data. 
    
    A key element of this approach to coordinate and integrate efforts on geospatial information is having a robust policy and legal frameworks, which ends up being  essential for an effective, efficient and secure management and exchange of geospatial information (UN-GGIM, 2020).
    
    Therefore, this indicator focuses on laws, policies, norms, treates, executive orders, directives, etc.  that set the guidelines to manage geospatial data in a country in an integrated and coordinated way, with the objective of maximizing the utility of geospatial data; leads to a secure management and sharing of this information, and clearly establishes responsibilities and mandates, strengthening governance and accountability in geospatial information management. 
    
    It has been said that geospatial data does not existe isolated, thus its frameworks might interact with and be derived from general government information policies such as those related to e-Government, national security, privacy, intellectual property rights, data availability, open data, standards, education, statistical and administrative data. 
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Start by identifying national frameworks (laws and or policies, etc) that refers specifically to geospatial data. A national framework of geospatial data might consist in multiple laws, policies, executive orders interacting with each other. If nothing is found, go to frameworks for e-government, open data and other related issues, that might mention geospatial data.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - [UN-GGIM country reports](https://ggim.un.org/country-reports/) provides summaries by country with updates on geospatial data national strategies.
    - **Search:**
        - Links and mentions to frameworks in Geoportals.
        - Explore National Mapping agencies websites.
        - Search by text containing "geospatial data" or similar in official laws and norms repositories.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Geodata specialists and communities.
        - Public officials working in mapping agencies
        - Open data officers
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Are there any laws, policies or guides that govern the collection and use of geospatial data?
    - If there are some laws, policies or guides in place, do they...
        - describe how data should be collected and released?
        - specify custodian(s) responsible for this data?
        - set out meta-data standards?
        - support interoperability between different agencies producing and releasing geodata?
        - consider location privacy issues?
        - supports data collaboratives?
        - specify how collection and management of this data is going to be financed?
        - set out a secure and reliable data flow?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    National frameworks for geospatial data are recommended to ensure coordination between agencies working with geodata at different levels at a national extent. However, if there is no national framework look for local frameworks that apply to sub-national levels and in the **Existence and** **Extent** parts of the question explain the situation.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     > "All countries and all sectors need geospatial information for national development, policy and decision-making. Geospatial information is presented in many forms and mediums and provides the integrative platform for all digital data that has a location dimension to it." (UN-GGIM, 2020, p.5)
     
     Geospatial information is a critical part of any national data structure. It serves to locate facts derived from a varied range of sources and this is vital for making decisions on national policies aligned with sustainable development (UN-GGIM, 2019).  Geospatial information might be gathered, used and shared by a wide range of institutions and agencies within a country, and can serve for multiple purposes. This have lead, in many countries, to a silos structure, where efforts to collect and maintain geodata are duplicated, and the opportunities and benefits from an integrated approach are missed.
     
     To take the best of geospatial information and contribute to sustainable development, tackling social, economic and environmental problems while contributing to enhance the knowledge economy, it is recommended to have an integrated approach that maximise, for a wide range of stakeholders, safe access to and use of geospatial data. (UN-GGIM, 2019). Historically, this kind of efforts have been reflected in building and maintaining National Spatial Data infrastructures, traditionally focused on collection of data and implementation technologies. Recent development on  geospatial data policy approaches, summarized by The United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM), have widen these approaches, adding focus on the "governance, policy, financial, capacity and engagement processes necessary to collect, maintain, integrate and share geospatial information, through all levels of government and society, in a modern and enabling technology environment" (UN-GGIM, 2019), and have named this approach as Integrated Geospatial Information programs or plans, which are depicted in their Integrated Geospatial Information Framework (IGIF).
     
     A key element of this approach to coordinate and integrate efforts on geospatial information is having a robust policy and legal frameworks, which ends up being essential for an effective, efficient and secure management and exchange of geospatial information (UN-GGIM, 2020), that affects the ways in which geospatial information is collected, used, stored and distributed, towards public good.
