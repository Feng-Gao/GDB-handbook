# Governance: Beneficial ownership of companies

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on the beneficial ownership of companies? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    A **beneficial owner** is a natural person who has the right to some share or enjoyment of a corporate vehicle’s income or assets, or the right to direct or influence the entity’s activities. An individual can own control, or benefit from a corporate vehicle either directly or indirectly. ([Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/en/implementation/beneficial-ownership-glossary/))
    
    Legally, both humans (natural persons) and companies (legal persons) can own, control, or benefit from companies. Sometimes, for purposes such as corruption, crime, or tax evasion, a human will seek to hide their ownership or control by using corporate vehicles like shell companies to obscure their identity. Beneficial owners are thus the individual human beings who ultimately own, wield control, or benefit, whether that’s openly or through corporate vehicles.
    
    The term “beneficial owner” can seem confusing. Different countries and languages have their own variations; sometimes, the same jurisdiction will use multiple terms. For example:
    
    - Bolivia: beneficiario final (final beneficiary)
    
    - Brazil: beneficiário efetivo (effective beneficiary)
    
    - Brunei: controllers
    
    - Canada: individual with significant control
    
    - Chile: beneficiario efectivo (effective beneficiary), beneficiario final (final beneficiary)
    
    - Colombia: beneficiario final (final beneficiary)
    
    - Czech Republic: skutečných majitelů (real owners)
    
    - Denmark: reelle ejer (real owner)
    
    - Ecuador: beneficiario final (final beneficiary)
    
    - France: bénéficiaires effectifs (effective beneficiary)
    
    - Gibraltar: ultimate beneficiary
    
    - Iceland: raunverulegur eigandi (actual owner)
    
    - Luxembourg: bénéficiaires effectifs (effective beneficiary)
    
    - Macedonia: ultimate beneficial owner
    
    - Malta: ultimate beneficial owner
    
    - Mexico: beneficiario real (real beneficiary), beneficiario controlador (controlling beneficiary)
    
    - Morocco: bénéficiaires effectifs (effective beneficiary)
    
    - Netherlands: ultimate beneficial owner
    
    - Nigeria: person of significant control
    
    - Norway: reell rettshavar (real right holder)
    
    - Panama: beneficiario real (real beneficiary)
    
    - Paraguay: beneficiario final (final beneficiary)
    
    - Peru: beneficiario final (final beneficiary)
    
    - Portugal: beneficiário efetivo (effective beneficiary)
    
    - Romania: beneficiarilor reali (real beneficiary)
    
    - Singapore: controllers
    
    - Spain: beneficiario ultimo (ultimate beneficiary)
    
    - Sweden: verklig huvudman (real principal)
    
    - UK: person of significant control
    
    - Venezuela: beneficiario controlador (controlling beneficiary)
    
    Most important is the substantive concept:  the de facto power of real, living humans over a company.
    
    It’s important to recognize that the focus of this indicator is on *beneficial ownership*, rather than legal ownership, shareholders, or directors. In most countries, information on the legal ownership (shareholders) and day-to-day control (directors) of a company has long been available. However, because individuals could often stay anonymous—for example, by linking companies that own each other across jurisdictions with different disclosure requirements—countries have started to legislate **separately** for beneficial ownership registers.
    
    A  **register** of the beneficial owners of companies thus extends beyond registration of the immediate legal owners, shareholders, or directors of a company to require identification and disclosure of the natural persons (individual, named human beings) who exercise ultimate ownership or control or derive economic benefit—even if this ownership, control, or benefiting involves multiple intermediate companies or relationships.
    
    Sometimes frameworks do not require a centralized register at all; instead, companies may be required to maintain their own registers without any more centralized disclosure. This indicator prioritizes disclosure. Disclosure doesn’t necessarily mean unfettered public access: sometimes frameworks establish a central register—or other unified access point—that law enforcement or other designated entities can access, but the general public cannot.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - In Ghana, the [Companies Act of 2019](https://www.gipc.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/COMPANIES-ACT-2019-ACT-992.pdf) (Act 992) defines a beneficial owner to include direct and indirect ownership and control, as well as receiving substantial economic benefit (Section 383). The Act also includes a protection regime (Section 47) and states that information must be updated within 28 days of changes and confirmed to be correct on an annual basis.
    
    - Austria’s [Beneficial Owners Register Act](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=20009980), which took effect in 2018, authorizes the registrar to automatically cross-check beneficial ownership information with data held in other state databases. The Act also mandates the registrar to perform risk-based supervision of its records, including auditing a random sample of higher-risk corporate vehicles. Further, the registrar is empowered to collaborate with the tax agency to apply financial sanctions for non-compliance. 
    
    - Armenia, which previously had limited sector-specific beneficial ownership registers, in 2021 passed [legislation](https://www.arlis.am/DocumentView.aspx?DocID=153756) requiring disclosures for the full economy from early 2023. The law mandates that information in the unified state register be made publicly available, with specific exceptions.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Beneficial ownership disclosure laws and frameworks are relatively new, and may have only been created in the last few years. Early frameworks for beneficial ownership disclosure were often sector-specific and limited—for example, covering extractives or companies involved in public procurement. Increasingly, however, such frameworks cover the entire economy. They may be broken down by type of corporate vehicle (e.g., there may be separate registers for companies, foundations, and trusts); some countries may also treat high-risk sectors differently. (For more information on beneficial ownership concepts, please[ review this primer](http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/primer/whatisbo.html).)
    
    Typically, you will find legislation for beneficial ownership registers either in a dedicated section of company law or anti–money laundering legislation, or in standalone legislation about beneficial ownership. There may also be an act with “beneficial ownership” (or the appropriate term in your country or language) in its name that legislates such changes to company law and/or anti–money laundering law. However, bear in mind: company law also covers information about *legal* ownership—so please check carefully to make sure you’re looking at *beneficial* ownership.
    
    If there is no framework in place, but your research identifies ongoing campaigns, advocacy, or legislative processes that could create such a framework, please make a note of this in the justification section.
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses availability of beneficial ownership data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
    
    	- The[ Open Ownership map](https://www.openownership.org/map/) contains information on commitments and plans made to introduce beneficial ownership registers, and implementation; note that the map isn’t proactively updated.
    
    	- [Country responses to FATF evaluations](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/) include an overview of commitments and actions to counter money laundering; search these for mentions of beneficial ownership. [FATF also publishes consolidated assessment ratings](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Assessment-ratings.html) that can offer insight into the state of beneficial ownership transparency in a country; Recommendation 24 (R24) addresses beneficial ownership transparency for companies.
    
    	- [Open Government Partnership National Commitments](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/policy-area/beneficial-ownership/) can be searched for commitments to introduce beneficial ownership registers.
    
    	- [The Financial Secrecy Index](https://fsi.taxjustice.net/country-detail/) includes questions on beneficial ownership (questions 471, 473, 485, within Secrecy Indicator 3) with references to source legislation.
    
    	- The[ Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative Country Pages](https://eiti.org/countries) for member countries include a section on beneficial ownership disclosure, which may describe the presence of national frameworks or an extractives-specific data collection process. (For more on EITI’s specific standards and requirements for beneficial ownership, see [section 2.5 Beneficial Ownership](https://eiti.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20EITI%20Standard.pdf).)
    
    	- The World Bank’s new [Business Ready (B-READY)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/businessready) and previous [Doing Business (2004-2020)](https://archive.doingbusiness.org/en/doingbusiness) surveys gather information about countries’ requirements around beneficial ownership registration when starting a business.
    
    	- [Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative’s beneficial ownership country guides](https://star.worldbank.org/publications?search=beneficial%20ownership%20guide). While some of these may be out of date, they can still start you off toward the right legislation.
    
    - **Search:**
    
    	- European Union countries were required by the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive to introduce measures for central beneficial ownership registers. Search for information on transposition of AMLD4 into national legislation.
    
    	- 'Beneficial ownership' + [country], and ‘beneficial ownership register’ + [country]. Look for news of recent consultations, laws, or debates. Often corporate service firms will report on new regulations or frameworks being introduced for a given country.
    
    	- Check the terminology list in the definitions and identification section for other terms that might also make relevant search terms in your country and language. Note: the terminology examples provided are not necessarily the *only* terms in use in a country.
    
    - **Consult:**
    
    	- Company transparency advocates (e.g., Transparency International chapters).
    
    	- Company registration agents.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there a current or planned requirement for companies to disclose their beneficial ownership to authorities, and will some or all of this information be made available to the public?
    
    - Does the framework clearly define the types of entity that must report their beneficial ownership? Does it cover both ownership and control held directly or indirectly, including through informal agreements or financial instruments? 
    
    - Does the framework cover both ownership (e.g., shares, rights to profit) and control (e.g., voting rights, other influence)? Does it also cover other forms of deriving substantial or significant economic benefit from companies?
    
    - Does the framework include exemptions for public disclosure of the identity of natural persons? Are any such exemptions clear and limited?
    
    - Does a company declaring their beneficial ownership only have to do this once, or is there a process set out in the framework for regular updates? (E.g., when ownership changes, or through annual reporting) 
    
    - Does the framework seek to ensure the quality of the data? For example, are any bodies empowered to ensure accurate and timely data? Is a verification process required?
    
    - Does the framework cover the majority of limited companies in the country or only a limited selection? (E.g., only companies operating in a single sector or in a single sub-national jurisdiction/state)?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Beneficial ownership data is valuable for a wide range of use cases, including:
    
    - Supporting anti-corruption and anti–money laundering investigations;
    
    - Enabling business intelligence and corporate due diligence;
    
    - Supporting cross-border and wealth taxation;
    
    - Governance of extractive industries and other high-risk sectors. 
    
    [Lord (2019)](https://stateofopendata.od4d.net/chapters/sectors/corporate-ownership.html) describes how, over the preceding decade, three issues came together to support a push for improved corporate data sharing, and in particular, better collection and sharing of data on beneficial owners: the 2008 financial crisis brought into relief the “dangers of uncertain information and unknown actors in financial markets”; a 2011 World Bank report on the abuse of anonymous companies; and international taxation and anti-money laundering reforms. These have all highlighted the need for interchangeable data not only on firms, but also on their ownership structures and the natural persons behind them. 
    
    Within the corporate information landscape, the concept of beneficial ownership has rapidly gained traction. Increasingly, countries require companies to disclose the identities of the individuals who hold ultimate ownership or control over or derive economic benefit from legal entities, cutting through layers of shell corporations and other complex arrangements ([Low and Kiepe 2020](https://www.openownership.org/uploads/definitions-briefing.pdf); [Russell-Prywata 2020](https://www.wealthandpolicy.com/wp/BP124_BeneficialOwnership.pdf)). 
    
    Some countries have responded to new requirements for beneficial ownership disclosure by updating existing corporate registers; others have developed dedicated beneficial ownership registers or disclosure regimes ([Financial Action Task Force/OECD 2019](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Best-Practices-Beneficial-Ownership-Legal-Persons.pdf)). Virtually all of the legal and regulatory frameworks for beneficial ownership transparency will have originated in an era in which administrations should be aware of the potential value of structured data. Consequently, tracking the extent to which these frameworks—and their related datasets—explicitly incorporate awareness of data can offer important insights into the degree to which countries are integrating a data-aware approach into new regulatory activities.
