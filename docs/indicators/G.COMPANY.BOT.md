# Governance: Beneficial ownership

The survey asks the question: To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing structured beneficial ownership data on companies?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    *"A beneficial owner is a natural person who has the right to some share or enjoyment of a legal entity’s income or assets (ownership) or the right to direct or influence the entity’s activities (control). Ownership and control can be exerted either directly or indirectly."*
    
    A public register of the beneficial owners of companies extends beyond registration of the immediate shareholders or directors of a company, to require identification and disclosure of the natural persons (individual named people) who exercise ultimate ownership or control - even if this ownership or control involves multiple intermediate companies or relationships. For more, please review **[this primer on Beneficial Ownership](http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/primer/whatisbo.html)** concepts.
    
    Beneficial ownership disclosure laws and frameworks are relatively new, and may have only been created in the last few years. Frameworks for beneficial ownership disclosure may exist covering all companies in a jurisdiction, or may only exist for specific sectors, such as extractives, or companies involved in public procurement. Some frameworks do not require a central register, and some do not allow public access to the collected data. 
    
    If there is no framework in place, but your research identifies ongoing campaigns, advocacy or legislative processes that could create a framework, please make a note of this in the justification section. 
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The [Open Ownership map](https://www.openownership.org/map/) contains information on commitments made to introduce beneficial ownership registers. It does not record which resulted in laws.
        - [Country responses to FATF evaluations](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/) include an overview of commitments and action to counter money laundering. Search for beneficial ownership.
        - [Open Government Partnership National Commitments](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/policy-area/beneficial-ownership/) can be searched for commitments made to introduce beneficial ownership registers.
        - [The Financial Secrecy Index](https://fsi.taxjustice.net/en/explore/database) includes indicators on beneficial ownership (471, 473, 485) with references to source legislation.
        - [Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative Country Pages](https://eiti.org/countries) for member countries include a section on beneficial ownership disclosure which may describe the presence of national frameworks, or an extractives-specific data collection process.
        - Consult [the description of the process for starting a business in the World Bank Doing Business survey](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies) and search for mention of beneficial ownership registration.
    - **Search:**
        - European Union countries were required by the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive to introduce measures for central beneficial ownership registers. Search for information on transposition of AMLD5 into national legislation.
        - 'Beneficial ownership' and country name: look for news of recent consultations, laws or debates. Often corporate service firms will report on new regulations or frameworks being introduced for a given country.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - **Company transparency advocates** (e.g. Transparency International chapters) ****
        - **Company registration agents**
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there a current or planned requirement for companies to disclose their beneficial ownership to authorities, and will some or all of this information be made available to the public?
    - Does a company declaring their beneficial ownership only do this once, or is there a process set out in the framework for regular updates? (e.g. when ownership changes, or through annual reporting)
    - Are any bodies empowered to verify the information submitted?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Where company registration is a sub-national responsibility, beneficial ownership disclosure may also take place sub-nationally. If you identify a sub-national unit with a stronger frameworks than any national framework that might exist (or not), assess this and choose the appropriate answer to the 'extent' question.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Beneficial ownership data is valuable for a wide range of use-cases, including:
     
     - **Supporting anti-corruption and anti-money laundering investigations**;
     - **Enabling business intelligence and corporate due diligence;**
     - **Supporting cross-border and wealth taxation;**
     - **Governance of extractive industries** and other high risk sectors.
     
     [Lord (2019)](https://stateofopendata.od4d.net/chapters/sectors/corporate-ownership.html) describes how, over the last decade, three issues have come together to support a push for improved corporate data sharing, and, in particular, better collection and sharing of data on beneficial owners: 
     
     - the 2008 financial crisis brought into relief the “dangers of uncertain information and unknown actors in financial markets”
     - a 2011 World Bank’s report on the abuse of anonymous companies; and
     - international taxation and anti-money laundering reforms.
     
     These have all worked to highlight the need for interchangeable data not only on firms, but also on their ownership structures and the natural persons behind them. The concept of Beneficial Ownership has rapidly gained traction within the corporate information landscape, with countries creating requirements for companies to disclose the individuals who have ultimate ownership or control of legal entities, cutting through layers of shell corporations or other complex arrangements ([Low and Kiepe 2020](https://www.openownership.org/uploads/definitions-briefing.pdf); [Russell-Prywata 2020](https://www.wealthandpolicy.com/wp/BP124_BeneficialOwnership.pdf)). 
     
     Case studies from the Financial Accountability Task Force describe how some countries have responded to new requirements for beneficial ownership disclosure through updates to existing corporate registers, whilst others have developed parallel beneficial ownership registers, or disclosure regimes ([FATF/OECD 2019](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Best-Practices-Beneficial-Ownership-Legal-Persons.pdf)).
     
     As the legal and regulatory frameworks for beneficial ownership transparency will virtually all have originated in an era where administrations should be aware of the potential value of structured data, tracking how far these explicitly incorporate awareness of data can offer important insights into how far countries are taking a data-aware approach to new regulatory activities.
