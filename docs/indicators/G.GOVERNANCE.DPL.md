    - **Sources:**
        - DLA Piper maintain [a detailed analysis of the privacy framework in over 100](https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html) countries. Comparing your country of study with other countries can help with judging the extent or key elements of the framework.
        - [Global Table of Privacy Laws (2017)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2992986) contains details of countries that, as of 2017, had or were drafting laws with 'largely comprehensive' coverage of public sector, private sector, or both (sec), and notes the presence and name of Data Protection Authorities (DPA).
        - **[DataGuidance.com](https://www.dataguidance.com/)** provides links to laws and summary information on Jurisdictions. (Note that the license of OneTrust's paid for services prohibits use of the content in third-party products. Use this source for background/contextual research only, and do not cite any verbatim text in justifications).
        - UNCTAD maintain a [dataset of draft or enacted privacy laws](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DTL/STI_and_ICTs/ICT4D-Legislation/eCom-Data-Protection-Laws.aspx) with links to a specific legal text. Check carefully to make sure the most recent law is referenced, as the UNCTAD data may not reflect recent legislative reforms.
        - The [WorldLii National Data Privacy Legislation](http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/NDPrivLegis/) collection also provides access to laws for a number of countries.
    
    - **Search:**
        - For news and articles about recent data protection or data privacy framework reforms.
        - The website of any data protection authority.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - National civil society focussed on privacy issues
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **Is there a single law that protects data in all settings? Or a patchwork of laws that apply to specific sectors, localities or media?**
    - 
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Where a country is divided into different sub-jurisdictions (e.g. data protection law is only set at the state level, or certain special zones are excluded from the main national data protection regime (c.f. [Greenleaf, 2013; pg. 5](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2280877)), this can be recorded in the extent question and should be clearly described in the justification.

        * The framework applies widely across all sectors and there is strong evidence that it is implemented effectively


=== "Indicator Justification"


     Data protection rights are rooted in the universally recognised right to private life, and act as a foundation for other fundamental freedoms, including freedom of association and expression. Gaining prominence since the 1970s as awareness  and understanding of the impact of data processing technologies developed, data protection rights can be characterised as modern and active rights: creating positive duties on different actors to manage data in ways that respect the wider rights of data subjects, and establishing the need for independent supervision of how data is handled ([Europ√§ische Union and Europarat 2018](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5b0cfa83-63f3-11e8-ab9c-01aa75ed71a1)). 
     
     Over the last 40 years, the majority of countries in the world have passed some form of data privacy law ([Greenleaf 2017](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2993035)) and rough consensus has formed on the essential principles of data protection law, drawing on the *[Council of Europe Convention 108](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/108)*, and *[OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data](http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm)*. Greenleaf identifies a total of 15 key principles across these two frameworks ([Greenleaf 2013](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2280877)), including limits on data collection, consent requirements, purpose limitations, individual access and correction rights, accountability of data controllers, and openness of policies on personal data. Greenleaf finds these principles widely applied in a sample of ten Asian countries, though with the notable exception of openness of policies on personal data which is only applied in six of the ten countries assessed (ibid.) 
     
     Over the last decade, a number of new concepts have gained prominence in data protection discourse, captured in [updated OECD](http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/privacy-guidelines.htm) and [Council of Europe documents](https://www.coe.int/en/web/data-protection/convention108/modernised). In particular these updates strengthened requirements for notification of data breaches (both CoE and OCED), and greater rights in relation to automated decision making (CoE), responding to concerns about applications of algorithmic decision making systems, and potential risks from big data. 
     
     There are a number of emerging issues related to data protection that may be addressed by future developments in this indicator after the pilot edition of the Barometer, including: 
     
     - **Group privacy**: Whilst data protection frameworks have generally been presented in terms of individual rights, there is growing focus on the need to address risks of big data that play out on the collective level ([Taylor, Floridi, and Sloot 2017](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319466064)), with resulting impacts both on individual autonomy and collective rights.
     - **Regulatory capacity:** In January 2019, the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data published '[Guidelines on Artificial Intelligence and Data Protection](https://rm.coe.int/guidelines-on-artificial-intelligence-and-data-protection/168091f9d8)' that call on governments to ensure that: *"Supervisory authorities should be provided with sufficient resources to support and monitor the algorithm vigilance programmes of AI developers, manufacturers, and service providers"*
