# Governance: Data protection 

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a comprehensive framework for protection of personal data? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    More than 100 countries have some form of comprehensive data privacy law that sets out how the privacy of individuals should be protected by the public and/or private sector when data is handled. In other countries, there may be a patchwork of regulations that covers specific sectors (e.g., health), or that applies only to certain public sector entities. 
    
    Strong data protection frameworks should include:
    
    - **Choice and consent**—providing individuals with clear information on how their data may be used and the choice to consent or not to it being collected and processed;
    
    - **Access and correction**—providing individuals with the right to access data held about them, and to ask for inaccurate information to be corrected;
    
    - **Responsibilities on data holders**—requiring data holders to manage personal data appropriately;
    
    - **Rights of redress**—giving individuals (or groups) rights to complain or take action where their data protection rights are breached
    
    Recent developments in global standards for data protection frameworks have also placed emphasis on:
    
    - **Breach notification**—placing a responsibility on data holders (e.g., companies, government departments, or others who collect and manage personal data) to notify the appropriate authority if personal data is accessed or shared illegally;
    
    - **Algorithmic decision-making**—creating specific rights and responsibilities in relation to personal data used within artificial intelligence systems or algorithms to make decisions that affect individuals;
    
    - **Group privacy**—recognizing collective rights to data protection, such as those detailed in various Indigenous data sovereignty principles. Also, creating specific responsibilities for data about group membership or that an individual shares that may simultaneously share information about others who have not provided consent. 
    
    This question also asks about how far frameworks apply in specific contexts, including:
    
    - **Location data**—location data can bring specific privacy risks. In some countries, this is explicitly addressed in the main data protection law. In other countries, there may be location-specific laws or regulations. This element asks you to check for evidence that the privacy risks of location data are recognized either in the main laws/regulations or in some other related law or regulation.
    
    Useful terminology:
    
    - **Data subject**—the individual human person that an item of data is about.
    
    - **Data holder**—the organization responsible for managing a collection of personal data.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - The [Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis\_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013protectionofpersonalinforcorrect.pdf) in South Africa provides a comprehensive framework for safeguarding personal data. It mandates obtaining consent for data processing (Chapter 3, Article 11\) and requires parties to correct personal information (Chapter 3, Article 24). Chapter 5 details the powers and duties of the Information Regulator, while Chapter 8 governs direct marketing and automated decision-making, and Chapter 9 addresses cross-border data processing  
    
    - For guidance, you can also refer to the [European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679), which sets uniform data protection standards across all member states. The GDPR enhances citizens' control over their data and boosts confidence in digital security. Key areas include ensuring data processing security (Article 32), promoting international cooperation (Article 50), facilitating information exchange (Article 67), and enforcing penalties for non-compliance (Article 84).  
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    For this question, you should consult existing resources detailing data protection frameworks, and identify which of the indicator's sub-questions these cover. You should also check for any recent updates that may not be reflected in the sources listed below and may affect your assessment.

    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Officers of national civil society organizations focused on privacy issues.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there a single law that protects data in all settings? Is there a patchwork of laws that applies to specific sectors, localities, or media? 
    
    - Does the framework apply to everyone, or are the specific populations, such as immigrants or the incarcerated, to whom data protection is denied either in full or partially?
    
    - What rights for data subjects does the framework recognize? Are there rights of choice and consent, access and correction, and redress?
    
    - What responsibilities on data holders does the framework recognize? Does it require particular data management practices? Breach notifications?
    
    - Does the framework include specific rights and responsibilities related to location data? To algorithmic decision-making?
    
    - Does the framework focus only on data protection for individuals, or does it include either explicit or implicit provisions related to groups as well?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Data protection rights are rooted in the universally recognized right to private life; they serve as a foundation for other fundamental freedoms, including freedom of association and expression. Since the 1970s, data protection rights have gained prominence as societies developed an awareness and understanding of the impacts of data-processing technologies. Data protection rights can be characterized as modern and active rights: creating positive duties on different actors to manage data in ways that respect the wider rights of data subjects, and establishing the need for independent supervision of how data is handled ([Europäische Union and Europarat 2018](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5b0cfa83-63f3-11e8-ab9c-01aa75ed71a1)). 
    
    Over the last forty years, the majority of countries in the world have passed some form of data privacy law ([Greenleaf 2017](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2993035)). Rough consensus has formed regarding the essential principles of data protection law, drawing on the [Council of Europe Convention 108](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/108) and [OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data](http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm). Greenleaf identifies a total of fifteen key principles across these two frameworks ([Greenleaf 2013](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2280877)), including limits on data collection, consent requirements, purpose limitations, individual access and correction rights, accountability of data controllers, and openness of policies on personal data. Greenleaf finds these principles widely applied in a sample of ten Asian countries, with the notable exception of the principle of openness of policies on personal data, which was only applied in six of the ten countries assessed (ibid.) 
    
    Over the last decade, a number of new concepts have gained prominence in data protection discourse, captured in [updated OECD](http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/privacy-guidelines.htm) and [Council of Europe documents](https://www.coe.int/en/web/data-protection/convention108/modernised). In particular, these updates strengthened requirements for notification of data breaches (both CoE and OECD) and established greater rights in relation to automated decision-making (CoE), responding to concerns about applications of algorithmic decision-making systems and potential risks from big data. Another area of increasing focus is collective rights to data protection, seen, for example, in the adoption of Indigenous data sovereignty principles (e.g., [Carroll et al. 2020](https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2020-043#the-care-principles-in-action)) or in specifications of data holders’ responsibilities with regard to data at the individual level that has group-level consequences or describes membership in groups.
