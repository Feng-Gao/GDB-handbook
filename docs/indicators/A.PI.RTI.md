# Availability: RTI performance data

To what extent is detailed RTI performance information available for public use? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    While most countries have some form of right-to-information (RTI) or freedom-of-information (FOI) framework, in practice not all implementations of these frameworks have lived up to expectations. 
    
    This indicator focuses on the availability of administrative data describing the **performance of a country's RTI/FOI processes**. Such administrative data may be required by law or simply provided by governments as part of good practice.
    
    To assess the performance of an RTI/FOI regime, data should include information on: number of requests submitted; response times for filling requests; denials and reasons for withholding; and appeals and their results. Further, data should be linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - The [UK Cabinet Office publishes](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-foi-statistics) RTI performance statistics on information on outcomes, reasons for rejection, and handling of appeals. Most data is updated quarterly, with additional annual updates. This comprehensive dataset covers government departments and other public bodies. The data is available in machine-readable formats and can be downloaded in CSV, HTML, or ODS formats.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    In some countries, national reporting on the performance of RTI/FOI practices is accomplished through a unified system, while in others such information is published by individual agencies. If in your country individual agencies report their own RTI performance data, you should **focus your assessment on the most representative example of common domestic practice. **If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other agencies, please briefly comment on this in the free text justification.
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses the governance of RTI performance data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
    
    	- Reports published by the information agency, media reports, and publications by development/donor agencies.
    
    	- National statistical offices or the appropriate governmental agency that houses statistical information.
    
    	- Independent oversight bodies, such as transparency councils, ombuds offices, offices of information services.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Government officials who handle appeals to denials of public records requests, in order to obtain a sense of the conditions in which an agency denies (or grants) information.
    
    	- Officers of civil society organizations with expertise in access-to-information issues.
    
    	- Journalists who report on government transparency or who use RTI/FOI requests as part of their practice.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **What information does the data provide? **For example, does it include number of requests, response times, exemptions and reasons, appeals and their results? 
    
    - **Is the data available at the level of individual agencies**, or only in aggregate?
    
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?

    * **Negative scoring:**
    
    * **This information is missing required data.** (There is no evidence of data gaps., There is evidence that a portion of mandated data is missing., There is evidence of widespread omissions in mandated data.)
     *In cases where the indicator itself identifies a dataset(s) to assess against—or a separate governance indicator has asked you to determine data requirements of a relevant governing framework—assess against that. In cases where there is no such identified dataset(s) or related governance indicator, please assess based on: the parameters laid out in the publication of the information (e.g., are some fields entirely empty when they shouldn't be?); your local knowledge (e.g., if the data is supposed to include information for all public officials, does the number of total entries seem reasonable?); and any broader research you may have done for this topic (e.g., have media articles decried the incompleteness of this data?). Note: this sub-question examines omissions only of mandated data; so if, for example, laws do not require the reporting of data below certain thresholds, that data is not considered “missing.”*

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Right-to-information practices are a key part of transparency and accountability initiatives that support members of a public in assessing whether and how consistently public officials use political power for the common good. This right to access the information that public authorities hold is recognized by the special mandates for the UN, OSCE, and OAS and connects directly with SDG 16.10.
    
    When RTI practices function well, they support oversight, reduce information asymmetries, and open a dialogue between members of the public and public officials. However, the quality, comprehensiveness, and attention to performance of these laws vary. Further, in practice a host of obstacles may impede the right to information laid out by legislation, such as slow response times, inappropriate use of exemptions, difficulties in contesting decisions—even lack of appropriate staffing and technical expertise among the relevant records officers can be a critical de facto impediment.
    
    This indicator investigates the administrative data that countries make available to describe the performance of their RTI/FOI obligations. In some cases, law may require the collection and publication of such data; in others, governments may simply provide it as part of good practice.
