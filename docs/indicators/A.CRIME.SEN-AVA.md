    **Elements**
    
    **Part 1: Data structure and openness.**
    
    * **Data is timely and updated.** (No, Partially, Yes)
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > When was the most recent update to this dataset?
    
    * **Dataset is available free of charge.** (No, Partially, Yes)
    
    * **Data is openly licensed.** (No, Partially, Yes)
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If No: If there are explicit restrictions placed on re-use of the dataset, briefly describe those here.
    
        > If Partially or Yes: If the data is provided with an explicit open license, please provide the name of the license, or a link to it here.
    
    * **Data is available in all the countryâ€™s official or national languages. If the country has no official or national languages, data is available in the major languages of the country.** (No, Partially, Yes)
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If Partially or Yes: Please briefly describe the language coverage available.
    
    * **Data is provided in machine-readable format(s)** (No, Partially, Yes)
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If Partially or Yes: Please provide a URL where this machine-readable data can be found. (Additional URLs can be included in the justification and supporting evidence)
    
        > If Partially or Yes: Please provide a comma separated list of the formats available? (E.g. csv, json)
    
        > If Partially: What prevents you from assessing this data as fully machine-readable? 
    
    * **The machine-readable dataset is available as a whole** (No, Partially, Yes)
     *Answer no if it's only possible to access individual records; Answer partially if it's possible to export extracts of the data; Answer yes if there are bulk downloads or APIs providing access to the whole dataset without financial, technical or legal barriers.*
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If Partially or Yes: Please provide a URL where bulk download access is available or described.

    **Part 3: Barriers to data availability of quality.**
    
    * **This information is missing required data.** (There is no evidence of data gaps., There is evidence that a portion of mandated data is missing., There is evidence of widespread omissions in mandated data.)
     *In cases where a separate indicator has asked you to determine data requirements of a relevant governing framework, assess against that. In cases where there is no such related governance indicator, assess based on the parameters laid out in the publication of the information, your local knowledge, and any broader research you may have done for this theme.*
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If There is evidence that a portion of mandated data is missing. or There is evidence of widespread omissions in mandated data.: Please briefly explain.

        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If Partially or Yes: Please briefly describe how COVID-19 affected the availability of this data.
    
    **Extent**
    
    * **How comprehensive is the data assessed for this question?**
        * The data assessed covers one or more localities, but there are many other localities without available data, or with data of a lesser quality.<blockquote class='supporting_questions'><strong>Supporting questions:</strong> <span class='supporting_question'>Which locality does this data cover?</span></blockquote>
        * The data assessed covers one or more localities, and is a representative example of the kind of data that can be found for all, or most, localities.
        * The data assessed provides national coverage.
