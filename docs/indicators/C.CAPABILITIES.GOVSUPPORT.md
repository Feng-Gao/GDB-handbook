# Capability: Government support for reuse

To what extent is there evidence that government is providing support for data reuse?  


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator tracks a wide range of actions to investigate whether a government consistently works to build, maintain, and develop a national culture of data reuse. It focuses on evidence of active, practical efforts rather than strategies that exist only in name. Relevant actions include but are not limited to: challenges, hackathons, virtual events, communication strategies, information sessions, reuse guides, and financial programs to support data reuse.
    
    Some governments may only support data reuse with regard to specific kinds of data. For example, open data strategies have long included components for creating communities to support the reuse of open government data. Recognizing the complexity of the contemporary data landscape, in addition to open data, this indicator examines support for the reuse of other types of data, such as private sector data and crowdsourced data, as well as support for working on data in a general way, regardless of its source or licenses. 
    
    **Example**
    
    - In France, [Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/politique-de-la-donnee), the national open data initiative, hosts [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) and [api.gouv.fr](http://api.gouv.fr/) for government agencies to publish data and promote reuse. Etalab also runs open data challenges and administers the [Fund for the Transformation of Public Action (FTAP)](https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/loffre-daccompagnement-de-la-ditp/fonds-pour-la-transformation-de-laction-publique-ftap), which supports modernization projects that harness the potential of data. In addition to its data catalog, [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) provides reuse guides and showcases nearly 4000 examples (as of August 2024) of data reuse, with topics ranging from environment and energy to law and justice.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:** 
    
    	- [ODB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kugw1mJGsZ7j0gsUxog32qG2aKc-EsIHYxRKX8-Xac/edit#gid=2026570716) notes for question ODB.2013.C7 may include relevant information, as of 2016. Some of those programs may still be operating, or may help you identify the organizations in charge of these kinds of activities.
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- Annual reports on the government's activities regarding data.
    
    	- Look for "news and updates" in national and local data portals.
    
    	- Explore updates from newsletters of government agencies working with data.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Relevant people from the open data community.
    
    	- Public officials working with open data and/or data in a general sense. 
    
    	- Scholars working on the local data issues.
    
    	- Officials at civil society organizations working with data, e-government, and relevant topics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there evidence of a government** strategy to support and encourage data reuse**?
    
    	- Does this evidence consist mainly of isolated examples, or does it show a coherent strategy with long-term objectives and plans?
    
    - For what** kinds of data **does the government provide support for reuse? For example, open government data, private sector or NGO data, or crowdsourced data. Or does the government encourage data sharing more broadly, regardless of sources and licenses?
    
    - In practice, **how is government supporting data reuse?**
    
    	- With challenges that offer prizes or other incentives to develop data-based projects, tools, and services?
    
    	- Through communication efforts, drawing on an active strategy to share information, tools, and guidelines for data reuse? This could be undertaken by various means, such as newsletters, social media activity, video tutorials, and other resources.
    
    	- Providing regular information sessions for different stakeholders, to share data reuse strategies and to receive feedback from stakeholders?
    
    	- Establishing financial aid or specific funding schemes for data projects?
    
    	- Organizing hackathons for developers to prototype tools and services over the course of a one- or two-day event?
    
    	- Bridging literacy gaps around AI and data reuse? This could focus on various topics; for example, reusing government data for AI or algorithmic decision-making; how a member of the public may obtain redress for inappropriate data reuse by such a system; general public guidance about how AI tools reuse data; etc.
    
    - For which stakeholders is support available?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Achieving the full benefits of data for public good—its range of uses, outcomes, and impacts—requires more than establishing legal frameworks and making data available. User engagement with data is crucial for ensuring positive outcomes and impacts that justify policies and initiatives ([OECD 2020](https://web-archive.oecd.org/2020-03-10/547558-ourdata-index-policy-paper-2020.pdf)). But data reuse isn't a single release–use trajectory. Rather, it is a complex process in which many different stakeholders interact, building an ecosystem within which stakeholders affect each other. 
    
    A government's actions to encourage data reuse are thus key components of a country's strategy for data for the public good. This indicator tracks what kind of support, if any, governments provide for data reuse.
    
    This indicator also provides continuity with ODB.2013.C.SUPIN, which asked, "To what extent is the government directly supporting a culture of innovation with open data through competitions, grants, or other support actions?"
