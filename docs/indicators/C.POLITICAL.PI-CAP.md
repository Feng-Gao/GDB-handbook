# Capability: Political integrity interoperability

The survey asks the question: To what extent is political integrity data interoperable across different political integrity datasets?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator looks at to what degree the different data classes and identifiers correspond across political integrity datasets. The lack of interoperability across these datasets has been a longstanding issue for researchers, journalists, and civil society organizations. 
    
    The focus here is not on matching a universal standard—this is a thematic area that doesn't currently have relevant data standards, though Transparency International has been working to develop some—but on governments increasing the usefulness of this data through thoughtful coordination. 
    
    This indicator thus calls for a meta-analysis of the five political integrity datasets already identified.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    Start from the data already located for political finance, interest and asset declarations, lobbying, public consultation, and RTI performance.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Are public officials identified using unique identifiers in the same identification system across the different political integrity datasets?
    - Are lobbyist clients and party and campaign donors identified using unique identifiers in the same identification system?
    - Are proposed rules and legislation identified using unique identifiers in the same identification system across the lobbying register and public consultation data?
    - Are interests, assets, and liabilities identified using unique identifiers in the same identification system across asset declarations and political finance disclosures?
    - Are corporations associated with donations, interests, assets, liabilities, and lobbying activities identified using unique identifiers in the same identification system across the different political integrity datasets?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    This question investigates the interoperability datasets that operate within the same level of government, although best practice involves not only interoperability across the same level of government but across national and sub-national levels.
    
    In some countries, political integrity data may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions, or cities. To assess countries where political integrity data is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practices across the different dimensions of political integrity data, assess these practices for interoperability, and then indicate whether this sub-national example is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

    **Extent**
    
    * **To what degree do the datasets associated with this theme use consistent identifiers and identification systems for elements that appear in more than one dataset?**
        * There is no consistency of identifiers or identification systems.
        * There is minimal consistency; at least one category of identifiers is consistent across two datasets.<blockquote class='supporting_questions'><strong>Supporting questions:</strong> <span class='supporting_question'>Please briefly explain what is consistent and what is not.</span></blockquote>
        * There is partial consistency; several categories of identifiers are consistent across multiple datasets or whole identification systems are consistent across at least two datasets.<blockquote class='supporting_questions'><strong>Supporting questions:</strong> <span class='supporting_question'>Please briefly explain what is consistent and what is not.</span></blockquote>
        * There is strong consistency; all of almost all of the element categories that appear in more than one dataset use consistent identifiers and identification systems.


=== "Indicator Justification"


     SDG 16 calls for governments around the world to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development; provide access to justice for all; and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels," with targets 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, and 16.10 focusing on specific matters of integrity and accountability. Similarly, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) commits countries to combat corruption in both the public and private sectors.
     
     Corruption often doesn't involve only a single act, type of act, or actor, but rather entails networks and flows. Data can be a critical tool in tracking illicit financial flows and otherwise fighting corruption, but when the relevant data types aren't interoperable, it may offer only a fragmentary picture. However, making such data interoperable—for example, using the same unique identifiers across different types of datasets—makes it increasingly useful.
