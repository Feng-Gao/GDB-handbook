# Governance: Lobbying register 

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on lobbying activities? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    While there are considerable differences in how lobbying activities are defined for reporting purposes—a key impediment to studying lobbying comparatively—there’s widespread consensus on the underlying concept of lobbying. Here we use the [International Standards for Lobbying Regulation](https://lobbyingtransparency.net/standards/regulatory-scope/)’s definition: lobbying includes “any direct or indirect communication with a public official that is made, managed, or directed with the purpose of influencing public decision-making;” moreover, as their guidance notes, “a lobbying definition should address commonly known forms of lobbying, where a lobbyist enters into direct contact with a public official, but it should also cover indirect lobbying activities, for example, where lobbyists mobilize other stakeholders to represent their views or hire consultancy firms to do lobbying work on their behalf.”
    
    Increasingly, governments at different levels are establishing frameworks to govern lobbying. Typically these take the form of **lobbying registers**. Lobbying registers track who engages in and with lobbying, how, and when. 
    
    This indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:
    
    - Lobbying registers contain structured data on the activities of **lobbyists, clients,** and **public officials**.
    
    - Lobbying registers include a **verification process**.
    
    - Lobbying registers are **regularly updated **in a manner that is** timely **and** responsive **to lobbying activities.
    
    - Lobbying registers are **published**.
    
    It's important to note that not every lobbying actor may be located in the same country. If a lobbyist in country A lobbies a local official in country A on behalf of a company located in country B, then lobbying registers in both country A and country B may in theory be expected to contain details of that activity. 
    
    **Examples**
    
    - Chile's [Law No. 20,730](https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1060115) defines lobbying activities, including lobbyists and their interactions aimed at influencing public decisions. It mandates a public register for lobbyists, requiring the reporting of meetings, hearings, trips, and gifts related to lobbying. This information must be published and updated monthly on official websites (Articles 7, 8, and 9).  
    
    - Canada's [Lobbying Act](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/l-12.4/) requires the disclosure of lobbying activities, including the identities of lobbyists, their clients, involved public officials, and the objectives and timing of engagements. Section 5 mandates that lobbyists file monthly returns detailing their activities and expenses. This information is publicly accessible via the Lobbyists' Registry, with the [Commissioner of Lobbying](https://lobbycanada.gc.ca/en/) empowered to investigate and ensure its accuracy, promoting transparency and accountability.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    In the case of lobbying, it's possible for a framework to require regular updates without those updates being timely or responsive to lobbying activities. For example, if a framework requires updates every year, those updates may be regular but not sufficiently responsive to specific lobbying activities to offer insights into which lobbyist clients may have influenced a public official's stance on a policy. Check to make sure the framework includes not just regular updates but** updates that are responsive to lobbying activities**.
    
    If there are multiple forms of lobbying registers operating under different frameworks, you should **focus your assessment on the most common domestic form. **If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other common forms of lobbying registers, please briefly comment on this in the indicator’s existence summary box.
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses availability of lobbying data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.

    	- For lobbying databases constructed by journalists or country-relevant NGOs that coordinate multiple streams of lobbying data; among other information, these may contain details on known gaps in this law or regulation.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Investigative journalists who focus on corruption and integrity issues in the country.
    
    	- Local officials of civil society organizations focused on transparency and accountability in governance.
    
    	- Lobbyists.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is the framework for disclosure and verification of lobbying activities provided for in law, regulation, policy, or guidance?
    
    - Does the framework focus on **lobbyists**, lobbying **transactions**, or both?
    
    - Does the framework provide unambiguous definitions of lobbying activities, or is there a pattern of confusion or disagreement about what constitutes a lobbying activity?
    
    - Does the framework empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data? Does it require a verification process?
    
    - Does the framework specify that information should be updated in a manner that is timely and responsive to lobbying activities? 
    
    - Which branches of government and government bodies does the framework cover?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    In recent years lobbying has become an area of increasing regulation, with a priority placed on understanding who specifically lobbies. Thus, regulations typically require some form of lobbying register. Depending on how registers are designed, they may include not only identities of lobbyists but also transaction data regarding meetings, briefs, and gifts. Such registers ground a great deal of new empirical research (see, e.g., Bombardini and Trebbi 2020; de Figueiredo and Richter 2014) on lobbying. At the same time, they have gaps: different definitions of what requires reporting, sometimes within the same level of government (e.g., Mexico); more or less stringent sanction and cross-verification practices; differing capabilities for surfacing grassroots lobbying.
    
    To understand both gaps and best practices across the world, this indicator investigates the frameworks countries have in place for collecting and publishing data on lobbying activities.
