# Use: Procurement Data - Government Analytics


!!! question "Feedback on draft Global Data Barometer Indicators"


    You are looking at a draft indicator to be included in the expert survey of the Global Data Barometer. Between now and April 16th we are inviting your feedback on this indicator and the elements it contains. 
    You can provide your feedback by (a) completing this form; or (b) adding in-line annotations.
The survey asks the question: To what extent is there evidence of government applying data analytics to improve procurement practice? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Procurement data analytics can be used to:
    
    - **Produce interactive dashboards** that report basic statistics such as procurement spend by department or category, the kinds of procurement processes used, and the length taken for each process.
    - Look for potential corruption or fraud risks using **red flag analysis**
    - Improve the **diversity** of procurement by reporting on, and developing strategies to improve, the number of bidders or contract winners from particular marginalised communities.
    - Assess and improve the **environmental impact** of procurement.
    
    This question asks about the use of analytics **by government**. The analytic tools used by government may or may not be public, and may or may not be based on data that is openly published. They may be produced by government, or may be civil society or private sector tools that government adopts in some way. Evidence may take the form of dashboards on government procurement portals, reports and presentations that detail government use of analytics, or reports that are clearly derived from detailed analytics. 
    
    If you locate tools that might be used by government, but cannot find evidence that government is actually using them, you can score a sub-question as 'partially'.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - "Government procurement dashboard" + [Country]
        - [Procurement Agency Name] "dashboard"
        - procurement red flag analysis + [Country / Procurement Agency Name]
    
    - **Sources:**
        - *No general sources have been identified for this question*
        - The [Open Contracting Partnership impact evidence pages](https://www.open-contracting.org/impact/evidence/) provide useful case studies that can help you to identify appropriate search terms or search strategies for your focus country.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Government procurement officials or experts
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    [ Guidance to be completed following sub-question confirmation during consultation ]
    
    - **Dashboards** - look for evidence of an interactive data-driven dashboard that draws on the data you assessed in the availability question.
    - **Red flag analysis** - look for evidence of data-driven red flag analysis tools (as opposed to just guidance to officials on how to 'look out for' red flags).
