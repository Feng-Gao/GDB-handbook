# Capability: Data skills of gov (PI)

The survey asks the question: To what extent do the agencies responsible for data on political integrity appear to have high levels of data capability?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Collecting and publishing political integrity data isn't sufficient for using it meaningfully, particularly as political integrity data is collected and published both to establish a positive culture of integrity and participation, and to monitor for abuses. 
    
    This indicator examines the extent to which the government agency or agencies responsible for collecting, publishing, and verifying political integrity data has high levels of data capability; it is based on the presence and strength of skills and tools that equip relevant government agencies with high levels of data expertise. Specifically, it looks for evidence whether:
    
    - A relevant agency or agencies has either dedicated positions that require data expertise and/or positions with responsibilities that require data expertise.
    - A relevant agency or agencies uses database platforms for managing information; these are evident in presentations by the agency, on the agency's public website, in budget or spending reports, or some combination.
    - A relevant agency or agencies uses advanced tools for data analysis; these are evident in presentations by the agency, on the agency's public website, in budget or spending reports, or some combination.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - Job descriptions and job postings that articulate specific, data-related responsibilities and skills.
        - The social media channels of the relevant agency or agencies for public presentations that show evidence of the use of database platforms or data tools; you may be able to find evidence, for example, in images or videos of slide decks.
        - The agency budget and financial reporting for specific software licenses and related purchases.
        - The site of the relevant agency or agencies for database platforms that allow members of the public to engage directly with the data, e.g., through search or comparison.
        - The site of the relevant agency or agencies for detailed and user-friendly data dashboards or scorecards that require regular updating, and/or frequent and notable use of data visualizations to usefully convey government-held data.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Government officials who work in the relevant agency or agencies; for practical purposes, consulting with whomever manages the agency's website can make a useful starting point as they will be involved in launching or maintaining whatever data tools and platforms are publicly visible.
        - Local journalists or officers of civil society organizations who handle political integrity data.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Are there personnel with strong training in how to analyze data?
    - When the agency communicates, either directly with the public or publicly with other branches of the government, do they draw on data tools and analysis?
    - Is there a data tool that you can engage with directly through the agency's website, or does data only exist in either static or downloadable form?
    - Is there a dashboard that requires (and receives) regular maintenance, or a pattern of using data visualizations to communicate meaningfully with the public?
    - Are there obvious data errors or clunky presentations of data that suggest lower levels of data skills?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries government data skills may be unevenly distributed, either because they have been cultivated by individual states, regions, or cities, or because they are associated with particular agencies.
    
    To assess countries where data skills are unevenly distributed, researchers should select the strongest examples of practice, and then indicate how widespread of a practice these examples are.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     SDG 16 calls for governments around the world to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development; provide access to justice for all; and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels," with target 16.5 specifically focused on ending corruption and bribery. Similarly, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) calls for transparency regarding the role of money in politics. 
     
     Data about political finance, lobbying activities, and other matters of political integrity can be useful tools that help government agencies and institutions to achieve aims of transparency and accountability. However, generating such data isn't in and of itself sufficientâ€”for agencies to meaningfully use data, they must also have sufficient data capabilities and skills.
