# Governance: Data management

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a comprehensive framework for consistent data management and publication?  


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    **Data management** refers to “The policies, procedures, and technical choices used to handle data through its entire lifecycle from data collection to storage, preservation, and use” (*[Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/data-management/)*; full entry is available in multiple languages). 
    
    The value of government data for the public good—regardless of whether that’s published as open data—increases when appropriate protections have been embedded operationally throughout collection and sharing, when data quality has been assured, when relevant technical standards are used, when data comes with clear documentation, when data is more easily discoverable, and when user feedback is sought. 
    
    Governments may promote consistent and high quality approaches to data management through a variety of routes, including:
    
    - National data strategies;
    
    - Data management guidance;
    
    - Data management standards.
    
    Data management frameworks contrast with data-sharing legislation or an open data policy. Data-sharing legislation and open data policies typically focus specifically on responsibilities related to making data available. Data management, however, applies to the data lifecycle comprehensively and focuses on creating the operational foundation required to address needs related to different stages of data.
    
    For example, this may include specifying quality control processes and standards and interoperability requirements; laying out schedules for updates and maintenance to datasets and relevant digital public infrastructure; establishing the technical and human practices necessary to ensure data protection; etc. 
    
    However, please note that because data management applies to the various stages of the data lifecycle, in some cases, data management provisions may be located in multiple laws, policies, or guidelines. 
    
    **Examples**
    
    - Korea's [Public Data Management Guidelines](https://www.law.go.kr/행정규칙/공공데이터관리지침/) establish essential principles and standards that public institutions must adhere to for the effective management and provision of public data. These guidelines dictate standardized formats and methods for public data, as outlined in the [Guidelines for standardizing databases for public institutions](https://www.law.go.kr/%ED%96%89%EC%A0%95%EA%B7%9C%EC%B9%99/%EA%B3%B5%EA%B3%B5%EA%B8%B0%EA%B4%80%EC%9D%98%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%84%B0%EB%B2%A0%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%ED%91%9C%EC%A4%80%ED%99%94%EC%A7%80%EC%B9%A8/). Additionally, the guidelines ensure stable and high-quality public data by setting clear requirements for quality management at each stage, in accordance with the public data provision standard in Appendix 3 of the Public Data Management Guidelines.   
    
    - In Uruguay public entities must adhere to Agency for Electronic Government and the Information and Knowledge Society (AGESIC) technical standards and the format and access provisions established in Law No. 19.179 when publishing data and associated metadata. In that sense. AGESIC has developed the [Framework for Data Quality Management in Digital Government](https://www.gub.uy/agencia-gobierno-electronico-sociedad-informacion-conocimiento/sites/agencia-gobierno-electronico-sociedad-informacion-conocimiento/files/documentos/publicaciones/dqframework-guia-rapida-modelo-v1\_6.pdf). 
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Look for the existence of government data management and/or publication guidelines and data standards policies. These may be found by searching the documentation of official open data catalogs, or through searching for recent government announcements on the topics.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
    
    	- The [qualitative data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kugw1mJGsZ7j0gsUxog32qG2aKc-EsIHYxRKX8-Xac/edit) from the Open Data Barometer may provide details of policies and strategies identified prior to 2017 generally, prior to 2019 for Latin America and the Caribbean; look for sheets with primary data on ODB context and impact and filter by question ID "ODB.2015.C3."
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- National standards for data management.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Government officials working on data management;
    
    	- Data users.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence of:
    
    - Adoption of international data and metadata standards (e.g., [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/), [DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description), [oData](http://www.odata.org/), [Best Practices for the Publication of Data on the Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/), etc.);
    
    - Interoperability frameworks being widely adopted;
    
    - Standardized processes for publishing and updating published government data;
    
    - Guidance for soliciting and processing feedback from external users.

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Maximizing the value of government data for the public good requires data to be quality controlled and made available for reuse in consistent, reliable ways. 
    
    The Open Data Barometer's 2017 Leaders Edition included an indicator (ODB.2015.C.MANAG) which asked the question, "To what extent is there a consistent (open) data management and publication approach?" This indicator is designed to provide broadly comparable data to the ODB indicator. It takes its guidance from the ODB's 0–10 scoring system, converting this into element checklist items that should yield similar scoring for similar situations.
