# Governance: Public consultation data

The survey asks the question: To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data generated through and about public consultation on rulemaking?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Public consultation processes are key foundations to the open information and data flows that data for public good builds upon. Here we investigate the transparency of a country's public consultation processes, with regard to both the data these processes generate and data about the performance and administration of these processes. 
    
    This indicator examines public consultation processes for executive **rulemaking,** including regulations, bylaws, and rules, sometimes known collectively as secondary legislation. The indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:
    
    - Comments generated through public consultation processes are collected and published.
    - Notice of comment, justification, proposed policies, supporting documents, and final drafts are collected and published as dockets.
    - The responses of public officials are collected and published alongside relevant comments.
    - Information about challenges to regulations that have been passed, the grounds for challenge, and the results of challenges are collected and published.
    
    **Note:** Countries may also use public consultation processes in conjunction with parliamentary legislation or proposed projects, particularly extractive projects with likely environmental impacts. If your country doesn't use public consultation processes in conjunction with regulatory matters, but does for projects or parliamentary legislation, please explain this briefly in the free text justification and assess here the framework that applies to project-based or legislative public consultation.
    
    If there are multiple forms of public consultation processes in this country—for example, applicable to different executive agencies or operating at national and sub-national levels—please explain this briefly in the free text justification and assess here the **most common domestic form**.
    
    If there are significant differences in how you would assess other common forms of public consultation, please explain briefly in the free text justification.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The World Bank's [Public Consultation in Rulemaking Database](https://rulemaking.worldbank.org/en/data/comparedata/consultation) offers assessments of 187 countries across a number of different elements of public consultation.
        - [OECD Database of Representative Deliberative Processes and Institutions](https://airtable.com/shrRYPpTSs9NskHbv/tblfOHuQuKuOpPnHh) (2020) includes examples across levels of government for OECD countries.
        - [Regulatory Governance in the Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/documents/regulatory-governance-in-the-open-government-partnership/#annex) (2020) offers details of current public consultation practices in more than twenty countries.
    
    - **Search:**
        - For recent updates to public consultation laws in the country; around the world, this is an area of increasing legislation.
        - For examples of current notices of proposed legislation and comment periods, which may mention frameworks that require later publication.
        - For news articles that mention public consultation; in many places articles appear in connection with extractive projects, indigenous sovereignty, or both.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Experts in administrative law.
        - Legislators.
        - Journalists who specialize in the affairs of executive agencies.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is the framework for public consultation provided for in law**,** through regulation, or through policy?
    - Does the framework require that an agency or ministry provide drafts of proposed rules to members of the public in advance, or does it only require agencies or ministries to provide the formal proposed rule? How are these versions published and archived?
    - Does the framework require that comments generated through the public consultation process be collected and published? Are restrictions or redactions applied to this; for example, around publishing personal identifying information associated with comments?
    - Does the framework require that reasoned responses from public officials be collected, published, and archived alongside relevant public comments? Or are responses published and archived separately—or not at all?
    - Does the framework specify that information about challenges to rules that have gone through public consultation practices, such as the number, grounds, and results of challenges, be collected and published?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries public consultation processes have been established by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    To assess countries where public consultation processes are organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Fundamental to democracy is the authority of the public and the involvement of the public in the act of governing, through voting as well as other forms of political participation. Public participation is well-recognized under international law as a fundamental human right, articulated in detail, for example, by the UN OHCHR in *Guidelines for States on the Effective Implementation of the Right To Participate in Public Affairs* (2018). Increasingly, as the OECD’s 2020 *Innovative Citizen Participation and New Democratic Institutions: Catching the Deliberative Wave* details, such political participation includes public consultation in law- or rulemaking processes. Public consultation in law- or rulemaking aligns with SDG 16.7, and is a component within Transparency International’s decision-making dimension of political integrity.
     
     As with right-to-information frameworks, public consultation frameworks fundamentally govern flows of information between members of a public and public officials, generating a stream of data as they do. Similarly as well, it's important to collect and publish data on the performance and administration of public consultation practices both from a transparency standpoint and to assess their efficacy.
