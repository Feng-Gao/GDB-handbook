=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator investigates how closely a country's current practices for administrative data about violence against women matches the minimums proposed in [Kendall (2020)](https://endvawnow.org/uploads/browser/files/a00._background_paper_on_vaw_admin_data.pdf), a background paper developed by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), in conjunction with UN and external experts. The minimum dataset proposal is in support of the five-year Global Joint Programme on Strengthening Methodologies and Measurement and Building National Capacities for Violence against Women Data, to run from 2018–2022.
    
    Aligned with this proposal, this indicator investigates administrative data about violence against women specifically in the context of physical, sexual, and psychological/emotional **intimate partner violence** (IPV) and **non-partner sexual violence** (NPSV); similarly, it focuses on adult women and uses behavior-based definitions.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use administrative data about violence against women to*:
    
    - provide an insight into the number of women utilizing particular services because of violence against women;
    - help estimate the need for such services and their costs;
    - contribute to understanding sector responses to violence and unmet need;
    - be used to quantify the need for training among service providers;
    - provide valuable information to evaluate programmes and policies, as well as to inform the generation of new or improved legislation, policies and procedures to respond to violence against women.
    
    *Uses drawn from Kendall (2020:9).
    
    **Note:** This indicator focuses specifically on administrative data; consequently, the data it examines cannot be used to accurately estimate the *prevalence* of violence against women; nor can the data the Barometer generates in response to this indicator.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - [Global Database on Violence Against Women](https://evaw-global-database.unwomen.org/en/countries); although the data hasn't been updated in many years and thus falls outside the scope of the GDB study, it includes links to where such data has been found in the past (if it has been found) organized by country.
    
    - **Search:**
        - Websites for national statistics office, department of justice, institute of health, ministry for women.
        - Websites for civil society organizations dedicated to ending violence against women. Because this is government administrative data, it is unlikely that a civil society organization will originate the data, but they may play a key role in making the data more accessible through publishing it—and consequently you may find it easier to locate the source of the data through them.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Officers of civil society organizations dedicated to ending violence against women.
        - Officials at national statistics office, department of justice, institute of health, ministry for women.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on the dataset to check the variety of fields included. 
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does the data include information that identifies the **type of violence**? For example, whether the violence is physical, sexual, or emotional/psychological.
    - Does the data include the **date that the reported violence occurred**?
    - Does the data include **demographic and relational information about the survivor**, including age, sex, and the survivor-perpetrator relationship?
    - Does the data include **demographic and relational information about the perpetrator**, including age group and sex? These might the age and sex reported by the survivor, or, if the service provider/administrative system has contact with the perpetrator, actual age of the perpetrator and sex.
    - Does the data include **details about registration of the violence**? For example, does it include the date of registry of violence, the registering entity/person, and their sector (if service provider)?
    - Does the data include **geographical information about where violence occurred**? For example, the city/village; if sub-national government is relevant in your country, this might also include state, province, etc.
    - Does the data include **location information about where the event occurred**? For example, home, school, work, public space, etc
    - Does the data include information that indicates whether **violence was perpetrated using a computer (cybercrime)**?
    - Does the data include information about **response to the reported violence**? For example, this might be with regard to services provided (yes/no/not applicable/survivor declined/survivor decided to come back later) or referral (yes/no/not applicable/survivor declined/ referral to which services).
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, administrative data about violence against women may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where administrative data about violence against women is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Addressing violence against women is critical to achieving SDG 5: achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, particularly target 5.2: eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation. It's also critical for both SDG 16: promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels (and particularly target 16.1: significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere), and SDG 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
     
     As "A Synthesis of Evidence on the Collection and Use of Administrative Data on Violence Against Women [(Kendall 2020)](https://endvawnow.org/uploads/browser/files/a00._background_paper_on_vaw_admin_data.pdf)," a background paper developed by UN Women demonstrates, administrative data can be a critical tool for improving responses to violence against women in a manner that centers and empowers survivors and holds perpetrators accountable. More specifically, it can provide important insights on the use of and demand for services; assessing the quality of services; case management; and understanding the capacity of response (6).
     
     Indeed, the 57th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2013 specifically called on member states to "Improve the collection, harmonization, and use of administrative data, including, where appropriate, from the police, health sector, and the judiciary, on incidents of violence against women and girls, including data on the relationship between the perpetrator and victim and geographic location, ensuring that confidentiality, ethical, and safety considerations are taken into account in the process of data collection, and improving the effectiveness of the services and programmes provided and protecting the safety and security of the victim" (quoted in Kendall 2020:10). 
     
     The minimum data set proposed by Kendall and used as the basis for this indicator takes a behavioral approach, following the WHO's Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence against Women, UNODC's International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), and the Gender-Based Violence Information Management System (GBVIMS), a partnership of UNFPA, IRC and UNHCR, although these initiatives examine  the prevalence of violence against women through population surveys, rather than use administrative records to improve care and just response.
