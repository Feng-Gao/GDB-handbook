The survey asks the question: To what extent is there evidence of businesses built upon government provided geospatial data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator aims to track evidence of business cases in which geospatial data plays a key role in the products and services offered; or where government provided geospatial data has boosted efficiency in notorious ways. As well as the economic impacts of these uses.
    
    You do not have to find the business cases and measure their impact by yourself, but to identify them in secondary sources such as academic or government reports on the economic impact of government provided geospatial data. 
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Identify secondary sources where you could find use cases and reports on the economic impact of re-use of open geospatial data, besides academic or government impact reports: business magazines, business association publications and reports and websites specialised in geospatial data in the country. There, examples of companies using government geospatial data might be mentioned in particular ways, or describing the general situation.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - Academic journals on geospatial issues
        - Business publications
        - Chambers of business associations publications
        - Government papers on use and impact of geospatial data
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Consultants on GIS
        - Geospatial data communities
        - Public officials of agencies providing geospatial data
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there evidence of product or services delivered by private sector that use open geospatial data?
    - Is there evidence of this use having a significant economic impact in the country?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Examples that only cover a sub-national unit (e.g. particular state or territory) can be included in the research for this question.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Opening geospatial data is meant to led to significant social, economic and environmental improvements. Within its impacts, it is highlighted how accurate and updated official geospatial data can foster private business. Some studies have quantified the economic impact of the availability of this data, that for example in the case of [Denmark](https://inspire-danmark.dk/media/2917164/20170317-the-impact-of-the-open-geographical-data-management-summary-version-13-pwc-qrvkvdr.pdf) it has been estimated in USD 187.000.000 in 2016, and recent improvements in British geotada availability are expected to [unlock US$14 billion of extra value for the economy every year.](https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/blog/great-britains-national-mapping-agency-embraces-automation/)
     
     This economic impact and boost of private sector can be generated by geodata by two main means, among others: in the production field, as a result of producing new products and services based on free access to geodata; and the efficiency field where the time value saved thanks to open and accurate geodata available is measured.
     
     This indicator aims to track business cases in which geospatial data boths plays a key role in the products and services offered; or where government provided geospatial data has boosted efficiency in notorious way.
