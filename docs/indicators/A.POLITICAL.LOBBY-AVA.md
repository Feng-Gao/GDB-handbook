# Availability: Lobbying data

The survey asks the question: To what extent is lobby register information available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    A lobbying register should include details on lobbyists, lobbying clients, and public officials, and track the contacts and transactions that occur between lobbyists and public officials, including when and with regard to what matters and how much money is exxpended. A register should include both regular updates and updates that are responsive to lobbying activities.  The best lobbying registers are rigorously verified, either by an agency with a mandate to investigate reports and sanction violations, through cross-verification of a public official's and lobbyist's records, or both.
    
    Although lobbying scandals occur worldwide, relatively few countries currently have frameworks that govern lobbying activities. The frameworks—and consequently datasets—that do exist appear across levels of government; in some cases multiple frameworks exist at the same level of government.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/11/30/influence-abroad-the-state-of-global-lobbying-disclosure/) assessed the different kinds of databases associated with lobbying registers in 2016; the most right-hand column includes links. (Note: all of the links to the spreadsheet itself are currently inaccessible, but the linked article has an accessible version embedded about halfway through.)
    
    - **Search:**
        - The lobbying register's site for details about data downloads, possible data formats, or APIs.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Investigative journalists who report on lobbying or money in politics more broadly, particularly any who appear to be using aggregate lobbying data.
        - Officials of civil society organizations that advocate for transparency and accountability regarding money in politics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **What information about lobbying activities does the data include?** For example, does it include information about the identity of participants, the date and time of activities, lobbyists' goals for activities, topics, and cost?
    - I**s the data not just regularly updated, but updated in a timely manner?** For example, is it updated in response to lobbying activities or in response to a calendar year or other unit?
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?
    - **Is there evidence that the availability of this data was affected by COVID-19?**
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, data about lobbying activities may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where administrative data about violence against women is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     In recent years lobbying has become an area of increasing regulation, with a priority placed on understanding who specifically lobbies. Thus, regulations typically require some form of lobbying register. Depending on how registers are construed, they may include not only identities of lobbyists but also transaction data regarding meetings, briefs, and gifts. Such registers ground a great deal of new empirical research (see, e.g., Bombardini and Trebbi 2020; de Figueiredo and Richter 2014) on lobbying. At the same time, they have gaps: different definitions of what requires reporting, sometimes within the same level of government (e.g., Mexico); more or less stringent sanction and cross-verification practices; differing capabilities for surfacing grassroots lobbying.
