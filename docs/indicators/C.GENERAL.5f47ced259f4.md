=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    For this indicator look for examples of strategies, initiatives or activities that demonstrate that sub-national and local governments have the capacity to collect, manage, share and open data. These can variate, and some of them might focus only on open data or sharing data practices (these could involved other types of data different from Open Data, such us private data sharing, or data collaboratives). The **Elements** of this indicator are goruped with the aim of capturing differences between capacities towards open data and shared data practices.
    
    Activities and strategies that demonstrates governments capacity in these data fields might include:
    
    - Local online portals
    - Local policies and laws
    - Dedicated local agencies
    - Training local civil servants
    - Strategies for data re-use (see indicator on government support for data re-use for  more context)
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Explore the landscape of local data environment by scanning and identifying selected elements in main cities and provinces. If there is evidence of some local capacities, in the **Existence** part of the indicator note if they tend to be limited or ad-hoc capacities, or whether there are sustained and institutionalised capacities in local environments.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources**
        - **OGP Local** initiative can guide you to local data strategies.
    - **Search:**
        - Local e-government portals
        - Local Open Data portals
        - Mentions to sub-national governments on national data strategies
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Data experts
        - Local government civil servants
        - Local data communities
        - Data policy makers
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there evidence of cities, regional and local governments having capacity to collect, manage, share and open data?
    - Is this evidence of isolated capabilities? Or there is evidence enough to unveil sustained and institutionalised capacities in local environments.?
    - Does this evidence encompass...
        - Local online portals?
        - Local policies and laws?
        - Dedicated local agencies?
        - Training local civil servants?
        - Strategies for data re-use?
        - Civil society engagement?
    - Does this evidence reflects capacities regarding open data or shared data practices?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    This indicator is focused on sub-national and local capabilities. In the **Extent** part you will have to assess if the elements found refer only to some isolated local governments or if they can be found throughout the whole country.

     **
        * No cities or regions show capacity to collect, manage, share and open data.
        * The examples given are exceptions: the majority of cities and regions do not have the capacity to collect, manage, share and open.
        * The examples given represent common practice: many cities or regions have comparable capacity to collect, manage, share and open data.


=== "Indicator Justification"


     Sub-national and city governments are often responsible  for delivering key services that has notorious impact in citizenÂ´s  everyday lives.  This local responsibilities and close relationship with people rise the need, and works as an auspicious background, to develop data strategies.
     
     The [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/), in its 5th principle, states that given this closeness governments have a crucial role in supporting citizen engagement on open data (Open Data Charter, 2021), providing local open data, as well as providing its combination with national-level data. Open Gvernment Partnership, as well, highlight the importance of local environment for open governments, through its initiative [OGP Local](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/ogp-local/), which invites participants to "learn how to use open government values such as transparency, accountability, responsiveness, and inclusion to better meet the needs of the citizens they serve."
     
     The accomplishment of this need for local data strategies is strongly dependant on sub-national and local governments capacities. [Canares, M. and Shekhar S. (2015](https://webfoundation.org/docs/2015/08/ODDC-Phase-2-Paper-Subnational.pdf)), in their research on sub-national open data initiatives in developing countries,  emphasise on the capacities and resources needed by local level governments to carry on successful open data strategies. 
     
     This indicator also provides continuity with ODB.2013.C.CITY which asked *"To what extent are city, regional and local governments running their own open data initiatives?*
