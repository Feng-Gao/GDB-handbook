# Governance: Language coverage & data

The survey asks the question: To what extent is there a robust framework that requires that data collection and publication processes be available in the country’s official or national languages? If the country has no official or national languages, are these processes available in the major languages of the country?

    What language is used during data *collection* will affect how well the person providing the data understands the interaction—with consequences for both meaningful consent and data quality. 
    
    Similarly, the languages in which data and its explanatory materials are *published* will affect who can use that data and how.
    
    **Official** and **national** languages are formal designations. 
    
    Even when a country has neither official nor national languages, it still makes decisions about language coverage. In these cases, try to assess how closely a country's language coverage matches the major languages used in the country. 
    
    In some countries, language coverage is mandated by a separate law that applies more broadly to government communications; in those instances, please note the relevant law in the space provided and briefly explain how it applies.
