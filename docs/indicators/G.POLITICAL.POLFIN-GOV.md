The survey asks the question: To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on campaign and party finance?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator examines frameworks that require political parties and political campaigns to disclose information about how they raise and spend money. Financial support may come from various sources, including donations, membership fees, and public funding.
    
    This indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:
    
    - Party and campaign finance data is collected and maintained as **structured data** across the whole country.
    - Financial disclosures contain structured data on **income**, **spending**, **assets**, ****and **debts**.
    - Financial disclosures are ****updated in a timely fashion; this includes both **regular updates** and updates that are **responsive to campaign-based schedules.**
    - Financial disclosures are **published.**
    - **A mandate** is given to an independent agency or institution to examine financial reports and/or investigate violations.
    - Sanctions for violations are enforceable and proportional.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The [IDEA Political Finance Database](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/political-finance-database) provides information on bans, public spending, regulation, and oversight mechanisms; sources are listed beneath questions; this longstanding database covers more than 180 countries. The linked regulations can also help you identify the country's relevant agency or agencies.
        - For countries in Eurasia, the [EuroPAM database](http://europam.eu/?module=overview) lists relevant laws and provides overviews of relevant bans, public spending, regulation, and oversight mechanisms; the database currently includes 34 countries.
    
    - **Search:**
        - For recent updates to party and campaign finance laws in the country.
        - The website(s) of the country's political finance agency or agencies for details of how they collect and manage data, and the basis of this in law or regulation; relevant agencies vary across countries; common ones include registrars of political donations and election commissions.
        - For examples of current forms used to register financial disclosures of parties and campaigns.
        - For political finance databases constructed by journalists or country-relevant NGOs that coordinate multiple streams of political finance data; among other information, these may contain details on known gaps in the country's laws or regulations.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Investigative journalists who focus on corruption and integrity issues in the country.
        - Local officials of civil society organizations focused on transparency and accountability in governance.
        - Elected officials, party staff members, people who have recently worked on political campaigns.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is the framework for disclosure and verification of party and campaign finance provided for in law, ****through regulation, or through policy?
    - Does the framework provide unambiguous definitions of campaigning activities, or is there vagueness or notable inconsistencies about what constitutes a campaigning activity or third-party campaigning?
    - Does the framework require publication of identifying information about donors, and if so does this include all donors or only some? Is information published as summary or in specific detail that links donors to their donations?
    - Does the framework require this information to be managed as structured data?
    - Does the framework require this information to be verified in some way?
    - Does the framework specify that information should be updated in a manner that is not only at regular intervals but is also timely and responsive to campaign activities?
    - If data from political finance disclosures is publicly available, is this on a legal basis? Or could the government choose to remove access to the data at any time?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, frameworks that govern political finance data may be established primarily by individual states, regions, or cities. To assess such countries, researchers should select the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) calls for transparency regarding the role of money in politics.
     
     While donating to a politician or political cause is widely considered a form of political participation, there is also widespread concern about the effects of money in politics—with particular questions regarding who donates to parties and campaigns, how much, and how that affects political outcomes. 
     
     Transparent campaign and party financing is thus critical for understanding whose interests shape parties, ballot initiatives, and the decisions of specific public officials.
