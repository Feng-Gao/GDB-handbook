=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Achieving institutions ready to work with, release and govern data requires motivated and skilled people. If states are to the best of data for public good, public servants should have solid data skills in data centred positions,  and a minimum level of data literacy throughout the more general positions.  "The cognitive challenges posed by data are unlike those of most other commodities in terms of understanding the scale and complexities of (potential) use. Governing data thus requires a strong technical capacity and investments in human capital development for those who collect, process, analyze, and use data to support evidence-based policy making, core government operations, and service delivery." (World Bank, 2021).
    
    To achieve this skilled workforce, governments should offer salaries to attract technical data scientist and compete with private sector; and also offer career development for them, along with continuous trainings focused on this technical profiles, as well as general data training for the wider general audience of public servants. 
    
    This indicator focuses on different strategies or punctual activities that governments carry on to deliver training to all public servants, some of them to set the basis for working with data, and others to improve the already existing capacities. This trainings can take place within particular agencies, throughout cross-cutting programs for all public administration, through on-line platforms, shared lectures, and so on. No matter the learning strategy, this indicator aims to track efforts to improve government´s capabilities to public servants training on data.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Start by identifying the public employment or public service national agency, and check either they mention trainings in a general sense, and data trainings in particular. You can also check for e-government or innovation institutions, that might be leading data trainings in the country.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - 
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Data literacy experts
        - Scholar and Civil Society Organizations working in topics such as e-government, state modernization, data for public good, etc.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there evidence of government´s actions to train civil servants on data matters? If there is evidence, are they isolated efforts or they are part of a wider strategy?
    - Are this data trainings targeting a general audience of public servants or are only focused on data scientist and other profiles already working intensively with data?
    - What kinds of topics this training refer to?
        - Data governance, including laws, policies and guides to collect and share data within government and with external actors.
        - Data gathering: how to collect data to then be able to take the most of it.
        - How to share data, strategies and knowledge on licences.
        - Data viz and storytellying
        - Data biases and risk on sharing data
    - How is the context in which this trainings are being deliveried?
        - Are they offered by a pre-existent training department?
        - Are they offered thanks to a partnership with an external institution, such as a university or CSO, or international organisations?
        - Has an external provided been contracted for isolated trainings?
        - Do public servants receive a certification when taking a training so there is a formal recognition as a professional development?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    This indicator is intended to track national level training initiatives. If there are no national training initiatives, the assessment will be a NO for all the questions. If there area sub-national initiatives, you can note it in indicator ["Capacity  Sub-National"](https://www.notion.so/Capability-Sub-National-0925616e2d31461da5b05f47ced259f4)

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Data literacy within public servants is a precondition for governments to take the most of data for public good, the latest World Bank report *Data for Better Lives* highlights civil servants´ data skills as a key component for well-functioning institutions for effective data governance, stating that "institutions can only carry out their roles effectively if their staff are capable of and willing to use good data to undertake their core operations, inform policies, and deliver services (...)Governing data thus requires a strong technical capacity and investments in human capital development for those who collect, process, analyze, and use data to support evidence-based policy making, core government operations, and service delivery"(World Bank, 2021). 
     
     This need is also noted by OECD in its analysis of Open Data throughout country members. In the context of achieving a data-driven public sector, which governs and manages data as a strategic asset to create public value, skilled and motivated public servants are the foundation for an effective and sustainable Open Data policy, and to promote the adoption of emerging technologies as AI within public sector [(OECD, 2020)](http://www.oecd.org/gov/digital-government/ourdata-index-policy-paper-2020.pdf).
     
     Despite this fact of the importance of data literacy within public servants, governments capacities to produce and work with data are not always in place ([State of Open Data](https://www.stateofopendata.od4d.net/chapters/issues/data-literacy.html)), since "there is currently not enough technical support for most public officials tasked with implementing open data projects."
     
     Public servants, thus, needs to have constant training on data literacy, either to develop basic skills to effectively govern data, or to improve and update existing ones. Training programs, therefore, should target different audiences inside government officials: some should focus on data specific positions to improve thier skills, and others on civil servants in a wider sense with different contents([Commonwealth of Australia, 2016](https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/data-skills-capability.pdf)): "We need to understand the different degrees of data literacy required for each public position. We can’t expect all public officials to become data scientists overnight and nor do we want this. What is needed is to “translate” data skills into practice" [(Apolitical, 2020)](https://apolitical.co/en/solution_article/why-data-literacy-is-a-key-skill-for-public-servants).
