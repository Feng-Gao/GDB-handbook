# Availability: Vital statistics

The survey asks the question: To what extent is civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) information available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    To be useful for population health purposes, civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) data should include its level of completeness by province, state, county, or other relevant regional category and list causes of death standardized to at least the 10th version of the International Classification of Causes of Death or other easily interoperable standard. 
    
    Birth information should include at least details about the child, the birth, parents, and the registration process. Mortality information should include at least data about age, sex, geographic location, and cause of death. (These correspond to the minimums articulated in WHO's 2012 [CRVS Resource Kit](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/CRVS_ResourceKit_2012.pdf?ua=1), pages 113–114.)
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use CRVS data to:
    
    - assess long-term health patterns;
    - identify disparities in causes of death with regard to at least sex, age, and location;
    - track the progress of efforts to address child mortality, maternal mortality, and mortality related to specific causes of death;
    - verify and update mortality data from health monitoring systems;
    - provide a foundation for calculating and understanding excess deaths for large-scale disease events such as COVID-19;
    - monitor the spread and distribution of noncommunicable diseases.
    
    **Note:** This indicator focuses specifically on health uses of CRVS systems. However, CRVS systems inform many areas of governance and planning. The birth registration CRVS provides is also fundamental for establishing contemporary legal identities, and CRVS data is key to planning around education, migration, employment, cities and housing, and many other areas.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The [Centre of Excellence for CRVS Systems](https://crvssystems.ca/country-profiles) host profiles for 27 different countries around the world, that include detailed information about CRVS systems, what they contain, and what agencies manage them.
        - [UNICEF](https://data.unicef.org/crvs/) hosts profiles of CRVS systems for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, drawing on information from 2016–2017; while profiles don't link directly to relevant datasets, they offer insights into what data should be collected in your country and what agencies may be involved.
    
    - **Search:**
        - Websites of your country's national statistical office, civil registration authority, center for health statistics, and health department.
        - Websites of civil society organizations focused on statelessness, gender equality and nationality laws, improving identity and birth registration, or issues related to being "undocumented."
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Officers of civil society organizations focused on statelessness, gender equality and nationality laws, improving identity and birth registration, or issues related to being "undocumented."
        - Academic or policy researchers who study population health, childhood mortality, maternal mortality, or other types of mortality or morbidity.
        - Officers of civil society organizations dedicated to the eradication of diseases that can cause death.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does the data include information on the completeness of vital statistics in different provinces, counties, or regions of the country? Or is it presented without any assessment of its various components' completeness?
    - Is cause of death standardized to some version of the International Classification of the Causes of Death (ICD) or a related, interoperable standard?
    - Is mortality data tabulated separately by at least age, sex, and underlying cause of death?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    CRVS data is typically published at the national level, by national statistics offices. Sub-national considerations, however, may arise in relation to the completeness of the data. Some countries, rather than publish incomplete data with guidance about data limitations, instead choose not to publish updated information.
    
    To address this possibility, focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where the most up-to-date CRVS data is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Understanding and improving population health is fundamental to ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages (SDG 3). More specifically, contemporary civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems serve as key tools for tracking progress on mortality (SDG 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.9); CRVS systems also provide basic health information that supports research on vaccines and medicines (SDG 3.B) and strengthens capacities for managing national and global health risks (SDG 3.D). In addition to being critical for understanding population health, CRVS systems also directly support SDG 16.9, "By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration." To support establishing and improving CRVS systems, the UN publishes its [Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System](https://www.un.org/development/desa/capacity-development/tools/tool/principles-and-recommendations-for-a-vital-statistics-system-revision-3/).
     
     With their extensive coverage, CRVS systems have been critical to understanding the coronavirus pandemic, particularly but not exclusively with regard to understanding the pandemic's excess deaths. At the same time, researchers have identified a number of clear areas for improving CRVS systems (see, e.g., WHO's CRVS Resource Kit 2012). One significant problem lies in handling incomplete reporting. Reporting disparities surface notably with regard to gender and location. Although there are accepted principles for working with incomplete CRVS data, some authorities may decline to publish relevant but incomplete data at all or publish it without noting its level of completeness. A second key problem, specifically with using mortality data to understand and improve population health lies in a lack of standardization of causes of death.
