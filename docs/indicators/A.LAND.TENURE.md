# Availability: Land Tenure 
To what extent is detailed land tenure information available as open data? 



=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and identification**

    Land tenure refers to “the right or mode of holding land. It covers ownership, lease, customary tenure (traditional rights/customary rights) and usage rights” ([UN Environmental Program](https://leap.unep.org/en/knowledge/glossary/land-tenure)). Land tenure data thus describes identifies who holds rights over land, which rights are held, and over which land. This data can be used to understand access to land and land tenure security, to identify the land ownership patterns, to track the transfer or alteration of properties, to adjudicate doubts and disputes, landscape in a country, to identify land concentration, to understand access to land and land tenure security, and for anti-corruption purposes. Land tenure data provides one form of evidence of the relationship of people to land and its associated natural resources, but neither surveying nor registration constitutes that relationship. (Please see the [FAO’s AGROVOC thesaurus](https://agrovoc.fao.org/browse/agrovoc/en/page/c\_12069) for definitions across languages.)

    Historically, land data was often stored in two different sets of records: a cadastre that detailed surveyed parcels and a register that detailed who held rights to land, with the two linked via parcel number. In digital systems these records are often—but not always—combined. Thus, the “land tenure dataset” this indicator examines may at times not be a single dataset but instead multiple datasets that cover the relevant information when combined. 

    Land tenure datasets typically rely on the existence of a national land registration system and database; land tenure data should provide information regarding specific parcels of land, and then **either**:

    * the rights held with respect to those parcels (e.g., whether it is owned land, common land, or unregistered land); **and/or**  
    * the actual subjects—people or entities—holding tenure rights.

    **Note:** A dataset that only provides details of land parcels, without any information on the tenure rights over the parcelsm, is not considered a land tenure dataset for the purposes of this survey.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Start by identifying the agency or agencies in charge of land registration and/or collection and publication of land tenure data. Look for registers, cadastres, and institutions working with land tenure of any type. Some countries have departments in charge of collecting and publishing land-related data, often in conjunction with geospatial data.

    In some cases, information on individual rights holders may be available under more restrictive licenses than general rights information. In these cases, you can indicate that data on individual subjects is ‘partially’ available.

    There may be cases in which available datasets only cover one kind of right hold: e.g., datasets of state-owned land, ownership by legal persons, or land concessions and customary land tenure. In these cases, conduct your assessment for the most open dataset(s), and indicate which kinds of tenure or data subjects are covered.

    **Starting points**

    * **Sources:**  
        -  The [World Bank Doing Business Ranking](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploretopics/registering-property) contains a subindex on "Transparency of Information" (inside "Registering property") that tracks who can obtain information on land ownership from the agency in charge of immovable property registration; the subindex includes links to the relevant agencies that may be helpful. Be aware, however, that the detailed information provided in the subindex applies only to each country's largest business city.  
    * **Search:**  
        - Releases of cadastral/register data;  
        - Geospatial datasets;  
        - Reports from government, civil society organizations, or international organizations on land tenure.  
    * **Consult:**  
        - Officials with organizations that work on land tenure issues; for example, tenure security, anti-corruption, economic development, etc.;  
        - Experts on land registration/land rights;  
        - Geospatial data experts;  
        - Rural reform advocates/experts;  
        - Land information agencies;  
        - Land registration agencies and/or national cadastres;  
        - Geospatial agencies;  
        - Open data portals.

    **What to look for?**

    Look for evidence that the data covers each of the following kinds of land tenure:

    * Land tenure data involving **natural persons** and land tenure data involving **legal persons**—some countries' datasets may only cover land owned by individuals, while other countries may make data about corporate (company) land ownership accessible as open data.  
    * **State lands**—in some cases, data about the land owned by government entities is managed separately and may not be included in the main tenure dataset. Sometimes, when the main tenure dataset is closed rather than open, data about state lands may be in a separate open dataset. Land concessions information may also be bundled with state land data.  
    * **Communal lands**—land held by communities, and may include records of indigenous lands and reservations.  
    * **Open access lands**—land anyone can access;, and may include national parks or common land.  
    * **Urban tenure and rural tenure**—some tenure datasets only cover urban or rural land. Check whether both are included, or whether separate datasets exist for urban and rural areas.

In cases where there is no such identified dataset(s) or related governance indicator, please assess based on: the parameters laid out in the publication of the information (e.g., are some fields entirely empty when they shouldn't be?); your local knowledge (e.g., if the data is supposed to include information for all public officials, does the number of total entries seem reasonable?); and any broader research you may have done for this topic (e.g., have media articles decried the incompleteness of this data?). Note: this sub-question examines omissions only of mandated data; so if, for example, laws do not require the reporting of data below certain thresholds, that data is not considered “missing.”*

=== "Indicator Justification"
    Land is a key element in every human civilization. The way in which societies interact with land has broad impacts, from shaping social and economic development, to supporting cultural, and even religious life. The eradication of hunger and poverty, and the sustainable use of the environment depend in large measure on how people, communities, and others gain access to land and other related assets (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2012). Even though data is recognized as an important asset for good land governance, for many stakeholders, collecting and publishing information about land has been a challenge for various technical, conceptual, and political reasons.

    Many initiatives, policy recommendations, and research papers highlight land tenure as fundamental to understanding land dynamics. Land tenure itself comprises a wide range of fundamental and complex topics. [LandVoc](https://www.landvoc.org/), an online thesaurus for land governance, for example, classifies within this thematic area concepts such as land tenure systems, tenure regularizations, indigenous land rights, housing rights, and land ownership. For this indicator the Barometer focuses on data related to different kinds of rights held by people and/or institutions over a piece of land.
