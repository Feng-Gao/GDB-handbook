# Availability: Real-time healthcare system capacity

The survey asks the question: To what extent is information about the real-time capacity of the healthcare system available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    To be useful, data about the real-time capacity of the healthcare system should be available at the level of individual facilities and include details such as the number, type, and availability of beds, tests, vaccines, ventilators, and staff.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible for different actors to use data about the real-time capacity of the healthcare system in various ways:
    
    - for everyday individuals to locate where to take loved ones for treatment or where to obtain vaccines;
    - for journalists, civil society organizations, and government officials to identify disparities in the healthcare system that will disproportionately impact members of marginalized communities;
    - for government officials to determine where and when to build surge or overflow facilities;
    - for healthcare providers to direct patients with COVID-19 symptoms to facilities with the current capacity to treat them;
    - for a wide range of actors to understand where resources are scarce and work to fill gaps in personal protective equipment (PPE), medical devices, vaccines, etc.
    
    This indicator emerges from data practices observed in conjunction with the coronavirus pandemic; the working assumption is that data will be found on COVID-19-related websites, run by the government, academia, or civil society.
    
    In countries where infection counts have significantly decreased, this data may have been available in 2020 but no longer be being updated in 2021. Many government COVID-19 response sites include archives of past data; we suggest checking the date ranges corresponding to peaks of infection in your country. However, if these peaks happened early in the global progression of the pandemic, we also recommend checking archives a couple of months later, as countries' data-reporting practices have evolved considerably over the course of the pandemic.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - National or sub-national government websites about how and where to go for testing and treatment of COVID-19.
        - Websites of civil society organizations or mutual aid societies that provide information about testing or treatment of COVID-19.
        - Websites of your country's national or local public health department, center for disease control, or center for health statistics.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Public health officials.
        - Records and analytics staff at healthcare facilities who are likely to know what information is reported, to whom, and how often.
        - Open data experts, programmers, and technologists who have organized data collaboratives or participated in other data-related efforts for COVID-19 response and recovery.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does the data include information about the capacity of individual facilities that reflects real-time or very recent changes? Or does capacity information only speak to long-term capacity, not how it is currently being used?
    - Does the data include specific details, such as the number and availability of beds, staff, tests, vaccines, and ventilators?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, sub-national departments of health may have different practices with regard to what capacity data they make available. Additionally, in some countries, data may be available only for hospitals in major cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where data about healthcare system capacity is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Healthcare system capacity data supports governments and other actors in distributing resources to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (SDG 3). This is particularly critical in the urgency of a public health crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. As the WHO COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP 2021) notes, "Health care systems and workers...are under extreme pressure in many countries in terms of capacity and capabilities, financial resources, and access to vital commodities and supplies including medical oxygen" (8). Real-time or very recent data about a healthcare system's capacity is critical to directing patients to available care and distributing resources equitably and effectively. 
     
     With the rise of highly infectious COVID-19 variants, the continued dynamic and uncertain course of the pandemic, and the uneven global distribution of vaccines, it will be considerable time before the pandemic is contained. In the meantime, real-time capacity data not only helps public health departments respond to changes in the pandemic, it also helps ensure the continuity of essential health services and provides a foundation from which to build readiness for other health emergencies.
