# Availability: Asset declarations

The survey asks the question: To what extent is interest and asset declaration information available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Disclosure datasets should provide a comprehensive overview of the financial state of all relevant public officials, clearly identifying their income, assets, and liabilities. In addition to regular updates, such data should include information on any significant changes in an official's assets and liabilities, for example, being responsive to changes in employment. Disclosure datasets should also clearly identify not only the public official but also any partners, family members, or other intimates required by the country to disclose interests and assets as well.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use disclosure datasets to verify that relevant public officials do not have interests that trigger conflict between their public responsibilities and private identity. Datasets may include information about interests that have been divested or placed in a blind trust or other mechanism designated by the country.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - The site of the country's relevant oversight agency or agencies; these may include, for example, an office of governmental ethics, public integrity agency, etc.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Investigative journalists who report on conflicts of interest, public officials' assets, or money in politics more broadly, particularly any who appear to be using aggregate interest and asset data.
        - Officials of civil society organizations that advocate for transparency and accountability regarding money in politics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **What financial and non-financial information does the data include?** For example, does it include information about income, assets and liabilities, and in kind or non-financial interests?
    - **Does the data include information about significant changes in assets?** For example, in response to a change in employment or substantial change in investments?
    - **Whose interests and assets are disclosed?** Does the data only include information about some public officials or all public officials? Does it include information about the interests and assets of an official's family or other intimates?
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?
    - **Is there evidence that the availability of this data was affected by COVID-19?**
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, asset declarations may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where asset declarations are organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Interest and asset declarations, sometimes referred to as wealth declarations or financial disclosures, have been used since at least 1960, when the Philippines passed its Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act requiring public officials to declare under oath their assets and liabilities at the beginning and end of their terms in office (Apostol n.d.). In 2003, the adoption of the UN Convention Against Corruption, which includes strong declaration practices, sparked a renewed focus on the declaration as an accountability mechanism. A World Bank study published in 2016 found that 161 of 176 countries had some form of interest and asset declaration, though these showed significant variation (Rossi, Pop, and Berger 2016).
