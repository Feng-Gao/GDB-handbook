=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    A framework for open (government) data may take the form of a law, policy, guidance or commitments. It will commit government to make non-sensitive government held data available for re-use both **legally** (e.g. through licenses and terms of use) and technically (e.g. through providing data in machine-readable formats). 
    
    For more about open data, [consult the Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/).
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Check the currency of any frameworks to confirm they remain active and are being implemented. Open data frameworks may exist as part of broader data strategies or policies.

    - **Sources:**
        - The qualitative data from past editions of the Open Data Barometer may provide details of policies and strategies identified prior to 2017, and in 2019 in Latin America
        - [The EU Data Maturity Report](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/dashboard/2020#country-overview) provides data on the state of open data strategies and policies in European Countries

    - **Search:**
        - General search for: 'Open data policy', 'Data strategy', 'Open Data Strategy'
        - Search academic search engines (e.g. Google Scholar) for recent papers on "open data" + [Country]

        - Open data advocates and experts
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can be used to assess each of the sub-questions below. 
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    You should focus your assessment on national policies, or policies set at the federal level in federal systems. In cases where no national frameworks exist, but strong frameworks have been developed sub-nationally, or in a particular significant agency, you may carry out the assessment for this, and record this limitation in the extent question.

    **Elements**
    
    **Part 1:**
    
    * **Senior politicians or government officials have made statements supporting open data** (No, Partially, Yes)
     *Only answer 'Yes' if statements were made within the study period. Answer 'Partially' for statements made outside the study period by an administration still in power, or statements that only express weak support.*
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If Partially or Yes: Please provide a URL to the most significant recent statement.
    
    * **Government has issued guidance to support open data publication** (No, Partially, Yes)
     *Answer 'Yes' if guidance remains current. Answer 'Partially' if guidance exists, but has not been updated or there are concerns about how far it is being implemented.*
    
        > **Supporting questions** (conditional)
    
        > If Partially or Yes: Please provide a URL to public guidance if available. 
    
    * **There is a national open data law, policy or strategy** (No, Partially, Yes)
     *Answer 'Yes' if the law, policy or strategy is current and being implemented. Answer 'Partially' if it is outdated but still influencing practice in some form. Answer 'No' if it is outdated and appears to have no current influence.*

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Promoting re-use of public data is central to realising the potential of data for the public good. Open data laws, policies or strategies provide the framework within which government data can be made available as a resource for third parties to work with.
     
     The Open Data Barometer leaders edition included an indicator (ODB.2015.C.POLI) which asked the question "To what extent is there a well-defined open data policy and/or strategy?". This indicator is designed to provide comparable data to the ODB indicator. It takes the guidance from the ODB's 0 - 10 scoring system, and converts them to element checklist items that should yield similar scoring for similar situations. It reflects the GDB's presumption that governance frameworks based in law are preferable to frameworks based in policy alone.
