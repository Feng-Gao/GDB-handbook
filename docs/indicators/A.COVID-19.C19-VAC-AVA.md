# Availability: Vaccination (COVID-19)

The survey asks the question: To what extent is COVID-19 vaccination information available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Data about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination should be specific and detailed regarding aspects such as number and type of doses available and administered, as well as what percentage of total doses this represents; it should provide basic demographic information about who is being vaccinated, such as age, sex, disability, and membership in a marginalized population; and it should include information regarding where vaccination is taking place and how the process is distributed across the country.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible for different actors to use data about vaccines and vaccination in various ways:
    
    - to track the state of vaccination in the country and the degree of presumptive COVID-19 immunity;
    - to assess and update public health restrictions such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, mask requirements, or distancing, as appropriate;
    - to determine if vaccination is occurring equitably;
    - to support analysis of the duration, efficacy, and other aspects of the various vaccines;
    - to plan for the eradication of COVID-19.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - Our World in Data provides a list of [sources by country](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations#source-information-country-by-country) for data on vaccinations.
    
    - **Search:**
        - National or sub-national government websites about how and where to go for vaccination, testing, or treatment of COVID-19.
        - Websites of civil society organizations or mutual aid societies that provide information about vaccination, testing, or treatment of COVID-19.
        - Websites of your country's national or local public health department, center for disease control, or center for health statistics.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Public health officials.
        - Open data experts, programmers, and technologists who have organized data collaboratives or participated in other data-related efforts for COVID-19 response and recovery.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does the data include specific details about vaccine supply and administration, or does it only offer very general information? For example, does it include the number of doses that health authorities possess and of what type; the number of doses administered, broken into partial and complete vaccination; and the percent of total doses administered?
    - Does the data include demographic information about the people who have been vaccinated? If so, what kinds? For example, it might include information about age, sex, disability, membership in a marginalized population.
    - Does the data include information about the geographic distribution of vaccinations? For example, does it include vaccinations by county, or perhaps by facility?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, data about COVID-19 vaccinations may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where data about COVID-19 vaccinations is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Successfully managing and ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is critical for ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages (SDG3). More specifically, SDG target 3.3 calls for combating communicable diseases, with specific attention to epidemics. Vaccines are fundamental to those efforts. 
     
     Accurate and timely vaccination data is important to responding effectively to the global health crisis. The manufacture of vaccines is limited to comparatively few countries, and several such countries have adopted stances of vaccine nationalism, hoarding vaccines. Consequently, the global vaccine rollout is and will continue to be uneven. At the same time, the virus itself continues to change, producing new variants, and there is still much we do not yet know about the duration and efficacy of the existing vaccines. All of these factors make high-quality vaccination data even more important.
     
     Further, within countries access to vaccines is not always equitable. As with testing and treatment, disparities are likely to track the social determinants of health; for example, with regard to location and demographic variables.
