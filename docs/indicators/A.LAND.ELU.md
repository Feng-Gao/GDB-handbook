# Availability: Existing land use

To what extent is existing land use information available as open data? 




=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and identification**

    Land use is commonly defined as a series of operations on land, carried out by humans, with the intention to obtain products, and/or benefits through using land resources. Land use refers to the purposes to which land is put; these may be residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, forestry, or recreational.

    This indicator focuses on data that describes actual uses of land rather than planned uses, asking about structured datasets that detail the kinds of activities occurring in particular locations, with associated geospatial references. Land use data should cover uses of public land and non-public land, as well as land use zoning and its enforcement; it should also include metadata that describes the land use nomenclatures and hierarchies used. Further, to track how land use changes over time, there should also be a well-maintained archive of previous existing land uses.

    **Examples**

    - The Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP) makes land use maps available for exploring [online](http://location.sa.gov.au/viewer/?map=hybrid\&x=138.73858\&y=-34.96443\&z=12\&uids=118\&pinx=\&piny=\&pinTitle=\&pinText=), as well as making them accessible through APIs and [downloads](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-sa-9712e707-1a7a-464e-a4c3-980f40770d48/distribution/dist-sa-98a4aae3-54df-4381-8f98-a39fa4f30b4e/details?q=land%20use).

    Note: Land use data may have different levels of detail, depending on the area covered. National land use maps tend to cover wider areas but with limited detail, while more local publications tend to offer detailed land use data in smaller units, such as parcels.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Start by looking for national-level datasets that provide information about current land uses, cover a wide range of land uses, and include geospatial references. You may find digital maps and/or other kinds of downloadable files such as .xls, .shp, .geoJSON, etc. If there is no single national dataset or repository of local datasets, look for land use datasets for smaller areas.

    As a methodological warning, land use data tends to be very localized. In some cases, national maps are published by combining different local sources. In some cases, gaps are filled by commercial initiatives. Often, different publishing systems within a country may not be consistent with one another.

    **Starting Points**

    * **Search:**  
        - Open data portals;  
        - National geographic institutes;  
        - Environment agencies;  
        - Land information offices;  
        - Geoportals.

    * **Consult:**  
        - Organizations that work with land issues;  
        - Experts on land use land use change (LULUC);  
        - Geospatial data experts;  
        - Climate action advocates.

    **What to look for?**

    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of land uses and other features included.

    Look for evidence of:

    * A land uses dictionary that provides an overview of possible land uses and the nomenclature used.  
    * A register or archive of previous uses that makes it possible to track changes in land use over time.  

    To answer the sub-question, ‘How comprehensive is the data available in terms of types of land uses?’ you will have to determine if the available land use data covers only one or a few land use categories (protected areas, industrial use, etc.), or if covers a wide range of land uses.

In cases where there is no such identified dataset(s) or related governance indicator, please assess based on: the parameters laid out in the publication of the information (e.g., are some fields entirely empty when they shouldn't be?); your local knowledge (e.g., if the data is supposed to include information for all public officials, does the number of total entries seem reasonable?); and any broader research you may have done for this topic (e.g., have media articles decried the incompleteness of this data?). Note: this sub-question examines omissions only of mandated data; so if, for example, laws do not require the reporting of data below certain thresholds, that data is not considered “missing.”*

=== "Indicator Justification"

    Good governance in land use is critical to achieving goals related to socioeconomic development, maintaining ecological systems, and enabling adaptation to climate change (Quan 2017). International organizations have identified effective land use and management as key for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and addressing issues such as desertification, food security, and employment and migration challenges.

    Both land use restrictions as well as land use decision-making processes should be transparent, efficient, and predictable (Deininger et al. 2011). Thus, the Food and Agriculture Organization encourages states to conduct regulated spatial planning and monitor and enforce compliance with those plans. This should be done in a manner that promotes diverse and well-balanced sustainable territorial development, taking into consideration the variety of tenure systems, as well as particular issues such as the gendered aspects of land use and indigenous peoples' land rights and uses (FAO 2012).

    When used in conjunction with land tenure or land ownership data, land use data opens up avenues for addressing environmental issues, corruption, land access, food sovereignty, housing, health, and a plethora of other challenges.

    This indicator focuses on current and historical land use data, with special attention to forest and protected areas.
