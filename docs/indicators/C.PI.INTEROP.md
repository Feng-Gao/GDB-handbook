# Capability: Political integrity interoperability

To what extent is political integrity data interoperable across different political integrity datasets, as well as other datasets associated with relevant information flows? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator looks at the interoperability of key political integrity datasets, both at the basic level of detailed documentation and consistency of formats and standards, as well as regarding the correspondence across datasets of data fields and identifiers. (An identifier is simply “the name for an object or concept in a database” (*[Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/)*; for examples, see entry; available in multiple languages).) The lack of interoperability across these datasets has been a longstanding issue for researchers, journalists, and civil society organizations. 
    
    The focus here is not on matching a universal standard—political integrity data doesn't currently have relevant data standards, although Transparency International has been working on their development—but on governments increasing the usefulness of this data through thoughtful coordination. 
    
    This indicator thus calls for a meta-analysis of the four political integrity datasets already identified (on political finance, interest and asset disclosure, lobbying, and RTI performance), plus a meta-analysis across the relevant datasets of the Barometer's company information, public finance, and public procurement clusters.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - In Estonia, most datasets and registries are interoperable through the country's digital infrastructure, supported by X-Road, a distributed data exchange layer. Individuals are linked via the “isikukood” (personal identity code), while businesses are connected through unique identifiers from the [business registry](https://ariregister.rik.ee/). Services like [www.teatmik.ee](http://www.teatmik.ee) leverage this interconnected data for enhanced functionality.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    This indicator asks primarily for a meta-analysis of datasets you have already identified and assessed, so we expect it to require minimal additional work with regard to searches or consultation. 
    
    Start from the data already located for political finance, interest and asset declarations, lobbying, and RTI performance. You're looking to determine whether these key datasets share common identifiers that facilitate mapping flows across the larger data ecosystem. You may want to look first for evidence of a system in use to ensure and validate the interoperability of these specific datasets; if found, spot check across several datasets to understand its application in practice. If you can find no evidence of a system for validating interoperability, assess the fields and metadata definitions of the datasets themselves to identify correspondences and differences; spot check across datasets to determine how consistent any correspondences are in practice. 
    
    After comparing the use of common identifiers across the key political integrity datasets, then compare them across the relevant datasets of company information, public finance, and public procurement. 
    
    **Starting points**
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Are the key political integrity datasets interoperable at a basic level? For example, are they accompanied by detailed documentation and metadata? Have they consistently been published in the same structured format? Do they share data vocabularies and standards?
    
    - Do the political integrity datasets share common identifiers that facilitate mapping flows across the data ecosystem?
    
    - Do the relevant political integrity datasets share common identifiers for public officials?
    
    - Do lobbying data and political finance data share common identifiers for lobbyist clients and party and campaign donors?
    
    - Do asset declarations and political finance disclosures share common identifiers for interests, assets, and liabilities?
    
    - Do the various datasets share common identifiers for legal persons (companies, nonprofits, and other legal entities) associated with donations, interests, assets, liabilities, and lobbying activities?
    
    - Do the political integrity datasets and relevant company information datasets share common identifiers?
    
    - Do the political integrity datasets and relevant land datasets share common identifiers?
    
    - Do the political integrity datasets and relevant public finance datasets share common identifiers?
    
    - Do the political integrity datasets and relevant public procurement datasets share common identifiers?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    SDG 16 calls for governments around the world to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development; provide access to justice for all; and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels," with targets 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, and 16.10 focusing on specific matters of integrity and accountability. Similarly, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) commits countries to combat corruption in both the public and private sectors.
    
    Corruption often doesn't involve only a single act, type of act, or actor, but rather entails networks and flows. Data can be a critical tool in tracking illicit financial flows and otherwise fighting corruption, but when the relevant data types aren't interoperable, it may offer only a fragmentary picture. However, making such data interoperable—for example, using the same unique identifiers across different types of datasets—makes it increasingly useful.
    
    This indicator thus investigates the interoperability of data across different political integrity datasets, as well as across other datasets associated with relevant information flows.
