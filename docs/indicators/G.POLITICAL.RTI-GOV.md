# Governance: RTI performance

The survey asks the question: To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on the performance of Right to Information (RTI) / Freedom of Information (FOI) processes?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Alternately framed as right to information (RTI), freedom of information (FOI), and access to information (ATI), most countries around the world have some provision by which members of a public can request information that is held by government. Significant differences exist in terms of which branches of government a request can be made of and what types of exemptions are allowed; further, in some countries distinct frameworks exist at multiple levels of government.
    
    Taking the RTI process as foundational to the open information and data flows upon which much data for public good builds, this indicator examines the transparency of a country's RTI process, as evinced through its performance and administrative data.
    
    Thus, this indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:
    
    - Information is collected and published regarding the number of RTI/FOI requests submitted and filled.
    - Information is collected and published regarding agencies' response times.
    - Information is collected and published regarding material withheld from requesters, either partially or entirely, and the reasons for that withholding.
    - Information is collected and published regarding appeals to RTI/FOI determinations and the results of these appeals.
    - Information is collected and published regarding remedies or sanctions applied to agencies that have not upheld mandated RTI/FOI responsibilities.
    
    If there are multiple forms of RTI/FOI frameworks operating in this country—for example, at national and sub-national levels—please explain this briefly in the free text justification and assess here the **most common domestic form**.
    
    If there are significant differences in how you would assess other common forms of RTI performance data frameworks, please explain briefly in the free text justification.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - Non-exhaustive databases of right-to-information laws: [RTI Rating](https://www.rti-rating.org/); [Constitutional
        Provisions, Laws, and Regulations](https://www.right2info.org/laws/constitutional-provisions-laws-and-regulations); [Public Accountability Mechanisms](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/public-accountability-mechanisms), and the [Africa ICT
        Policy Database](https://www.ictpolicy.org/countries#/topiccountries/7).
        - The Access to Information Commitments in [OGP](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/) Action Plans. See also the
        [database of commitments and progress report](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-data/).
        - Regional analysis such as AFIC's [State of Right of access to Information in Africa Report](https://africafoicentre.org/ati-in-africa/) (currently through 2017).
        - For COVID-19 disruptions or changes with regard to access to information, RTI Rating offers a specific [COVID-19 Tracker](https://www.rti-rating.org/covid-19-tracker/).
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Government officials who handle appeals to denials for request of information, in order to obtain a sense of the conditions in which an agency denies (or grants) information.
        - Civil society organization officers with expertise in access-to-information issues.
        - Journalists who report on government transparency or who use RTI/FOI requests as part of their practice.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does the framework require that basic administrative data about the RTI/FOI process, such as the number of requests submitted and filled, be generated and published?
    - Does the framework require that agencies, either individually or through a unified system, not only track how long it takes them to fulfill RTI/FOI requests, but also publish that information?
    - Does the framework require that agencies not only track when and why material is withheld from requesters, whether partially or in full, but also publish that information?
    - Does the framework require agencies not only to track appeals to RTI/FOI determinations and their results, but also to publish that information?
    - Does the framework require the publication of data on any remedies or sanctions applied to agencies for not upholding mandated RTI/FOI responsibilities?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries frameworks that govern RTI/FOIA performance data have been established by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    To assess countries where such frameworks are organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Right-to-information practices are a key part of transparency and accountability initiatives that support members of a public in assessing whether and how consistently public officials use political power for the common good. This right to access the information that public authorities hold is recognized by the special mandates for the UN, OSCE, and OAS and connects directly with SDG 16.10.
     
     When RTI practices function well, they support oversight, reduce information asymmetries, and open a dialogue between members of the public and public officials. However, the quality, comprehensiveness, and attention to performance of these laws vary. Further, in practice, a host of obstacles may impede the RTI that legislation lays out, with regard to the timeliness of response, inappropriate use of exemptions, difficulties in contesting decisions—even lack of appropriate staffing and technical expertise among the relevant record officers can be a critical de facto impediment.
