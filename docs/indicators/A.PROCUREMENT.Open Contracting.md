# Availability: Public Procurement Data


!!! question "Feedback on draft Global Data Barometer Indicators"


    You are looking at a draft indicator to be included in the expert survey of the Global Data Barometer. Between now and April 16th we are inviting your feedback on this indicator and the elements it contains. 
    You can provide your feedback by (a) completing this form; or (b) adding in-line annotations.
The survey asks the question: To what extent is detailed structured data on public procurement processes available as open data? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Governments enter into many contracts for the provision of goods, services and public works. They may publish data about these in tender lists, through contract finder websites, procurement portals, or through open data portals. 
    
    In some cases, public procurement data may be be held in a single system. At other times, different stages of the procurement process (planning, tender, award, implementation) may be held in different datasets, or a government may publish 'notices' with or without identifiers that make it possible to connect up data from different stages of the procurement process. 
    
    Look for services that aggregate data from across government - not just single departmental websites. However, if no such service is available, check a selection of the biggest government departments and note if they publish their contract data in any form.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The Open Contracting Partnership [maintains a map of cities and countries publishing procurement data](https://www.open-contracting.org/worldwide/#/) using the Open Contracting Data Standard.
        - The [Global Public Procurement Database](https://www.globalpublicprocurementdata.org/gppd/) country profiles provide links to procurement agency websites, national e-Procurement systems, and links to 'OCDS' data where available.
    
    - **Search:**
        - National data portals for 'Contracts' or 'Procurement' datasets
        - The website of the National Procurement Agency for open data, APIs or data exports
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Transparency experts or journalists writing about procurement: ask about known limitations of contracting data.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on the dataset to check the variety of procurements included. 
    
    Look for evidence of:
    
    - **Which stages of the procurement process is data available for?** Check for details of contact awards, and implementation information (spending and performance).
    - **Goods and services contracts** - these can range from low value to high value contracts covering a wide range of supplies to government.
    - **Public works contracts** - these are often higher value contracts, involving construction work - such as building schools and hospitals, roads and other infrastructure.
    - **Procurement from a range of government departments** - does the dataset appear to contain only procurement from a single department? Or from across government?
    - **Procurement from sub-national government units** - if you find procurement for sub-national entities in the dataset, does this appear to be comprehensive, or could it just be voluntary publication by a few local government units?
    - **Bulk data access** via downloads or APIs. For example, can you export a search as XLSX and does the resulting data contain relevant data fields? Or is there documentation for an API that allows access to full data records?
    - **Persistent data -** can you find data from last year? Or the year before? Does it appear that old data is being kept archived? Or does old data expire from the platform?
    - **Is the data is structured according to an established standard**, such as the [Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS)](https://standard.open-contracting.org/)
    
    Dashboards and other public analytic tools may help you to assess the comprehensiveness and coverage of the data. 
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Even within federal countries, national governments will carry out significant procurement activities. In some federal systems, national government (or supranational institutions) provide portals that centralise tenders and other procurement data. 
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    If there is no evidence of procurement data being available at the national level, but there is a strong example of data availability from a sub-national government, or a specific agency, you may carry out an assessment for this data, and use the extent question to note that this only covers a very limited number of procurements.
