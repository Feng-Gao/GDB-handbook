# Availability: Beneficial ownership of companies

To what extent is detailed information about the beneficial ownership of companies available for public use? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    A beneficial ownership register should contain details of the **natural persons** who have an **ownership** or **control stake** in or **benefit from** registered companies.
    
    To recap, legally, both humans (natural persons) and companies (legal persons) can own, control, or benefit from companies. Beneficial owners are the individual human beings who ultimately own, wield control, or benefit, whether that’s openly or through corporate vehicles. This indicator investigates data that describes the *beneficial owners* of companies, rather than legal owners, shareholders, or directors.
    
    A **register** of the beneficial owners of companies must thus extend beyond the immediate legal owners, shareholders, or directors of a company to identify and disclose the natural persons (individual, named human beings) who exercise ultimate ownership or control or derive economic benefit—even if this ownership, control, or benefiting involves multiple intermediate companies or relationships.
    
    Where company registration is a subnational responsibility, beneficial ownership registers may also be maintained subnationally. To achieve the highest scores on this indicator, it should be possible to easily access data about all the beneficial owners of companies in a country. This might be achieved by:
    
    - Having a central register of companies’ beneficial owners;
    
    - Government providing an aggregation service that brings together data from local registers; or
    
    - Having standardized or comparable-quality data available from every subnational register, such that a third party can easily aggregate the data.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - In Nigeria, members of the public can use its [Persons of Significant Control (PSC) register](https://bor.cac.gov.ng/) for free and without registration. Available search fields include entity name, entity number, and full name of the beneficial owner (here, person with significant control). Register data, which follows the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard ([BODS](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.3.0/)), is published under an open data license and can be downloaded in JSON format.
    
    - [Companies House](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/) in the UK publishes structured and machine-readable data about beneficial owners (as persons with significant control), with information available to the public directly through its online search tool as well as through an application programming interface (API); data can be bulk downloaded in CSV format.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Just as beneficial ownership disclosure laws and frameworks are relatively new, so too are their associated registers. Different countries handle such registers differently. Some countries have registers that cover the entire country; others manage registers at subnational levels; others may have both subnational registers and a national portal that provides a unified access point to multiple subnational registers.
    
    In some countries, registers may also still be sector-specific or limited—for example, covering extractives or companies involved in public procurement. Increasingly, however, registers cover the entire economy. Registers may be broken down by type of corporate vehicle (e.g., there may be separate registers for companies, foundations, and trusts); some countries may also treat high-risk sectors differently. Further, some countries do not require a centralized register at all, but rather may require companies to maintain their own individual registers.
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses governance frameworks for beneficial ownership disclosure in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:** 
    
    	- The [OpenOwnership map](https://www.openownership.org/map/) links to a number of registers of beneficial ownership (but is not exhaustive or always entirely up to date). These registers have varying levels of public accessibility.
    
    	- [The Financial Secrecy Index](https://fsi.taxjustice.net/country-detail/) includes questions on the availability of beneficial ownership information (see particularly question 485 within Secrecy Indicator 3) and includes links to registers.
    
    	- [Open Government Partnership National Commitments](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/policy-area/beneficial-ownership/) can be searched for commitments to introduce beneficial ownership registers.
    
    	- The[ Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative Country Pages](https://eiti.org/countries) for member countries include a section on beneficial ownership disclosure, which may include links to registers. (For more on EITI’s specific standards and requirements for beneficial ownership, see [section 2.5 Beneficial Ownership](https://eiti.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20EITI%20Standard.pdf).)
    
    	- Global Witness reporting on EU Beneficial Ownership registers from March 2020 [includes links to a number of available registers](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/anonymous-company-owners/5amld-patchy-progress/).
    
    	- The [Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative resource library](https://star.worldbank.org/resources?search=beneficial%20ownership) contains a series of country guides (developed in 2016/17) aimed at public authorities seeking to access company and beneficial ownership information across borders; search these for “beneficial ownership” and filter by country. These can provide context on the kinds of data collected and (as of their time of publication) made available to the public. 
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- Search the website of the national company register or registrar for mentions of beneficial ownership or related terms (see the associated governance indicator for a nonexhaustive list of terms across languages and countries).
    
    	- 'Beneficial ownership' + [country].
    
    	- 'Ultimate beneficial owner' + [country].
    
    	- 'Beneficiary owners' + [country].
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Transparency campaigners.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Are members of the public able to access beneficial ownership information, or is it only provided to certain parties (e.g., those that can demonstrate a legitimate interest, such as banks or law enforcement)?
    
    	- Note: in cases where a register exists but is not public, the best sources of information about it are likely to be announcements from industry and government about relevant anti-money laundering (AML) legislative changes.
    
    - Does the data contains unique identifiers for each company?
    
    - Does the data contains clear and robust identifying information for each beneficial owner? Does it include only names and address or nationality, or does it also include persistent identifiers such as birth dates? Is it sex- and/or gender-differentiated?
    
    - Does the data contains comprehensive details of the interests held by each beneficial owner? Does it include not only details about the nature of an interest—such as whether it is shares, voting rights, ownership, or control—but also its size? (E.g., 25% of the shares, or 40% of the votes.) Does it also include details about other forms of deriving substantial or significant economic benefit from companies?
    
    - Does the data cover only a limited set of companies? E.g., from a single economic sector or only those that registered or updated their records after a certain date.

In cases where there is no such identified dataset(s) or related governance indicator, please assess based on: the parameters laid out in the publication of the information (e.g., are some fields entirely empty when they shouldn't be?); your local knowledge (e.g., if the data is supposed to include information for all public officials, does the number of total entries seem reasonable?); and any broader research you may have done for this topic (e.g., have media articles decried the incompleteness of this data?). Note: this sub-question examines omissions only of mandated data; so if, for example, laws do not require the reporting of data below certain thresholds, that data is not considered “missing.”*

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Beneficial ownership data is valuable for a wide range of use cases, including:
    
    - Supporting anti-corruption and anti–money laundering investigations;
    
    - Enabling business intelligence and corporate due diligence;
    
    - Supporting cross-border and wealth taxation;
    
    - Governance of extractive industries and other high-risk sectors. 
    
    [Lord (2019)](https://stateofopendata.od4d.net/chapters/sectors/corporate-ownership.html) describes how, over the preceding decade, three issues came together to support a push for improved corporate data sharing, and in particular, better collection and sharing of data on beneficial owners: the 2008 financial crisis brought into relief the “dangers of uncertain information and unknown actors in financial markets”; a 2011 World Bank report on the abuse of anonymous companies; and international taxation and anti-money laundering reforms. These have all highlighted the need for interchangeable data not only on firms, but also on their ownership structures and the natural persons behind them. 
    
    Within the corporate information landscape, the concept of beneficial ownership has rapidly gained traction. Increasingly, countries require companies to disclose the identities of the individuals who hold ultimate ownership or control over or derive economic benefit from legal entities, cutting through layers of shell corporations and other complex arrangements ([Low and Kiepe 2020](https://www.openownership.org/uploads/definitions-briefing.pdf); [Russell-Prywata 2020](https://www.wealthandpolicy.com/wp/BP124_BeneficialOwnership.pdf)). 
    
    Some countries have responded to new requirements for beneficial ownership disclosure by updating existing corporate registers; others have developed dedicated beneficial ownership registers or disclosure regimes ([Financial Action Task Force/OECD 2019](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Best-Practices-Beneficial-Ownership-Legal-Persons.pdf)). Virtually all of the legal and regulatory frameworks for beneficial ownership transparency will have originated in an era in which administrations should be aware of the potential value of structured data. Consequently, tracking the extent to which these frameworks—and their related datasets—explicitly incorporate awareness of data can offer important insights into the degree to which countries are integrating a data-aware approach into new regulatory activities.
