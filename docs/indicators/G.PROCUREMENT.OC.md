# Governance: Public procurement data

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on government procurement? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Many governments spend a substantial proportion of their budget through procurement: contracting with private sector providers to supply goods and services or undertake public works (e.g., construction projects). Almost all public agencies, from central to local government, will carry out procurement at some point.
    
    Procurement involves a number of stages, from **planning**, to **tender** (inviting bids), **award** (issuing a contract), and **implementation** (monitoring performance of the contract). In some cases, governments may award contracts without a bidding process, or through some special negotiated procedure.
    
    Procurement laws, regulations, policies and guidance describe the processes through which governments should enter into contracts and the information on different stages of the procurement that should be disclosed. Many of these require publication of planning and tender documents, and some require publication of details of contract award and performance information. In some cases, countries have different rules for goods and services and for public works; there may also be different rules around publishing information related to direct awards and special procedures.
    
    This indicator is specifically focused on whether **national **procurement laws, regulations, policies, or guidance support publication of **structured **and **open data**. In general, this will only be possible where there are requirements for procuring entities either to use common data standards/systems, or to submit data to a central platform.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - Ukraine's [public procurement law](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/922-19#n606) specifies in detail the information to be published for each contracting process via the central e-procurement system, explicitly requires publication as open data, and includes penalties for non-compliance.
    
    - In Chile, all procurement information published by state entities must [by law](https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=213004&idVersion=2023-12-11&idParte=10475396) be available in open and reusable data formats in the country’s public procurement information and management system.
    
    - Part 8 of the UK’s [2023 Procurement Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/54/part/8/enacted) mandates the establishment and operation of an online system to publish notices, documents, and other information in a manner both free of charge and accessible to people with disabilities.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses availability of public procurement data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
    
    	- The[ Global Public Procurement Database](https://www.globalpublicprocurementdata.org/gppd/) country profiles list relevant national procurement laws and regulations.
    
    	- The[ Transparent Public Procurement Rating (TPPR) project](https://www.tpp-rating.org/) provides periodic assessments of procurement laws and processes for around 40 countries. Country assessments containing references to relevant laws can be downloaded from country result pages.
    
    	- For countries in Europe, the[ EuroPAM database](http://europam.eu/?module=overview) lists relevant procurement laws and provides an overview of thresholds, mechanisms; the database currently includes 34 countries.
    
    	- [The OGP Explorer](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/explorer/all-data.html)** **contains details of country commitments to improve procurement transparency.
    
    	- [Open Contracting Partnership’s legislative guide](https://www.open-contracting.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/OCP2021-OCLegislative-Guide.pdf) (2021) provides examples of how countries have included open contracting provisions in their laws and regulations, with detailed examinations of frameworks in Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Portugal, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
    
    - **Search:**
    
    	- For recent updates to national procurement laws.
    
    - **Consult:**
    
    	- Procurement experts
    
    	- Transparency advocates
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Do laws, regulations, policies or guidance explicitly support the collection (and/or publication) of **structured data**?
    
    - Do the laws, regulations, policies or guidance that require data collection and transparency cover all forms of procurement (goods & services, public works, direct awards, etc.)?
    
    - Is there a requirement to collect and publish data at each stage of the procurement process (planning, tender, award, implementation/spending & performance)?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Having a legal, regulatory, or policy framework that supports the collection and publication of procurement data provides a foundation for data analysis that can promote public good outcomes and mitigate against risks of corruption, inefficient spending, or negative externalities.
    
    The Open Contracting Partnership list four example use cases of procurement data:
    
    - Securing value for money in procurement;
    
    - Detecting fraud and corruption;
    
    - Increasing competitiveness of public contracting;
    
    - Monitoring service delivery.
    
    These use cases benefit from structured data available across the procurement cycle and from reliably provided data. Where the rules governing procurement inhibit digitization (e.g.,[ prescribing use of paper forms without providing resources for their digitisation](https://developmentgateway.org/blog/the-state-of-data-in-open-contracting/)); fail to require data to be collected or disclosed on all stages of the procurement process; or exclude certain types of procurement from data collection and disclosure requirements, the reliability and usefulness of data may be reduced.
    
    While a number of projects currently review public procurement rules around the world, we currently lack a unified dataset that describes the laws, regulations, policies, or guidance that support collection and publication of procurement data.
