# Availability: Biodiversity

The survey asks the question: To what extent is information on endangered species and ecosystems available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Information about endangered species and ecosystems should be comprehensive and easily accessible to support integrated approaches to climate and biodiversity. Red lists should include a wide range of taxa, beyond the more commonly studied terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants. Historical data and a complementary green list, focused on recovering species, should be available to help identify successful practices and understand patterns of change. To support collaborative data collection work across actors, the data repository should have a mechanism to support contributions from additional actors. Data should follow a common standard, such as the Darwin Core, and be nationally validated through government participation, publishing, or some other means. 
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use red lists to easily and accurately assess the current state of the country's species and how it has changed over time, to identify vulnerable species and ecosystems, and to compare data about species' population and distribution across national borders. 
    
    In some countries, national red lists may be maintained by governments; in others such lists may be led and managed by conservation groups or other civil society organizations. The latter may reflect the long history of collaboration across communities and borders with regard to species data, making conservation groups well-positioned to facilitate such a list. In other cases, it may reflect newer biodiversity data sources. In either case, it's important to assess whether the data is validated such that the government can use it for public good as well. For example:
    
    - A national ministry of nature and environment could be partnering on the effort—collaborating on the generation of data, providing funding or other support, etc.
    - An environmental protection agency might publish the data on their site.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The IUCN's list of [national red lists](https://www.nationalredlist.org/) can serve as a starting place, to be checked against the relevant national ministry or agency.
        - [National reports](https://www.cbd.int/reports/) to the Convention on Biological Diversity may include relevant information, depending on the country.
    
    - **Search:**
        - Websites for ministries of the environment.
        - Websites for civil society organizations focused on conservation, biodiversity, climate change, environment, nature.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Officials in your national or local environmental or conservation office.
        - Scholars or researchers at civil society organizations who research conservation and biodiversity in your country.
        - Officers at civil society organizations who work on implementing conservation or biodiversity projects within communities.
        - Journalists who report on conservation, biodiversity, climate change.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - How comprehensive is the red list? Does it include only terrestrial vertebrates or [vascular plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_plant)? Does it include invertebrates such as insects? Aquatic animals and plants? [Non-vascular plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-vascular_plant) and fungi?
    - If data on threatened species and ecosystems is generated and managed by non-governmental actors, does the government participate in validating the data or otherwise recognize it as nationally validated? For example, is a relevant government agency a collaboration partner, is the data accessible through government sites, etc.
    - Does the data use an accepted standard such as the [Darwin Core Standard](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core)?
    - Is there a "green" list that details recoveries of species or ecosystems? Is there a de facto green list through information about how the status of species or ecosystems has changed over time?
    - If you wanted to contribute data, is there a clear means for you to do so?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, data about endangered species may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by or for specific states or regions.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where data about endangered species is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Biodiversity, or the variety and interconnectedness of life, intertwines with the climate crisis: Species and ecosystems play key roles in regulating the climate. Consequently, habitat loss and ecosystem degradation compromise the ability of the planet to repair anthropogenic and other damage. The IPBES 2019 Global Assessment found that “Biodiversity—the diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems—is declining faster than at any time in human history” (10). At the same time, climate change is the third leading driver of biodiversity loss (IPBES 2019). And, as the WWF Living Planet Index recently explained, climate change is projected to become “as, or more, important than the other drivers” (2020:12). Despite this critical importance of biodiversity to climate and planet, governments failed to achieve any of the Aichi 2020 Targets for Biodiversity (Convention on Biological Diversity 2020).
     
     The research community widely agrees that significant data shortfalls hinder our understanding of biodiversity and our ability to take action on biodiversity loss. Hortal et al. (2015) identify gaps with regard to the identity and distribution of species as critical, for such information serves as the foundation for understanding larger patterns and processes (537). They note, too, that when data is available, it tends to be heavily biased toward terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants (535). Similarly, the IPBES, as part of a larger overview of knowledge gaps, within the category of “data, inventories, and monitoring on nature and the drivers of change,” identified gaps in four key data inventories: the World Database on Protected Areas, the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas™, red lists of threatened species and ecosystems, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (2019: 55).
     
     The global red list of endangered species that the International Union of Nature (IUCN) publishes has been used around the world to understand biodiversity and prioritize conservation goals. However, meaningful action at national and subnational levels often requires significantly more local information; and while biodiversity data resources continue to grow, many are not created in conjunction with national ministries of environment, making them difficult to use. In analyzing a user needs assessment of more than 60 parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity with regard to using spatial data for conservation and sustainable development purposes, the UN Biodiversity Lab noted that “This ‘data gap’ takes a toll on national efforts to protect and restore nature and related ecosystem services. Regardless of how much data is generated at the global scale, countries need a mechanism to assess its relevancy to their country, supplement it with local data, prioritize areas essential for protection and restoration, and engage with diverse stakeholders to demonstrate the importance of nature to society.” (2018, concept note 2) The IUCN itself calls for standardized national and regional red lists to complement their global list and facilitate international conservation treaties and legislation.
