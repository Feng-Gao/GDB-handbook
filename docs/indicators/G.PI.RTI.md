# Governance: RTI performance

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on the performance of right to information (RTI) / freedom of information (FOI) processes? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Alternately framed as right to information (RTI), freedom of information (FOI), and access to information (ATI), most countries around the world have some provision by which members of a public can request information that is held by government. Significant differences exist in terms of which branches of government a request can be made of, and what types of exemptions are allowed. Further, in some countries distinct frameworks exist at multiple levels of government.
    
    Taking the RTI process as foundational to the open information and data flows upon which much data for public good builds, this indicator examines the transparency of a country's RTI process, as evinced through its performance and administrative data.
    
    This indicator thus focuses on frameworks that govern the **performance** **data** of RTI/FOI processes. (A separate indicator, built from secondary data, assesses RTI/FOI governance frameworks themselves.)
    
    This indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:
    
    - Information is collected and published regarding the number of RTI/FOI requests submitted and filled.
    
    - Information is collected and published regarding agencies' response times.
    
    - Information is collected and published regarding material withheld from requesters, either partially or entirely, and the reasons for that withholding.
    
    - Information is collected and published regarding appeals to RTI/FOI determinations and the results of these appeals.
    
    - Published RTI performance information is linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - In Indonesia, [Article 12 of the UU KIP](https://www.law-democracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Buku-UU-KIP-eng.pdf) (Public Information Disclosure Law) mandates that all public authorities submit annual reports on their law implementation, particularly request processing. These reports must include statistical data on the number of requests refused and the exceptions cited, average processing times, and details on proactive publication, record management, and training.  
    
    - As a guidance, [article 65 of the OAS model law](https://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/docs/publication\_Inter-American\_Model\_Law\_2\_0\_on\_Access\_to\_Public\_Information.pdf) recommends that mandated agencies submit annual reports to the Oversight Body detailing their compliance. These reports should include the number of information requests received, granted, or denied, with disaggregation by gender and other demographics where possible, including indigenous groups and economically disadvantaged persons. The report should also cover the number of delayed responses with justifications, the sections of the Law invoked to deny requests, response times, and the number of appeals against denials, disaggregated by gender.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    If there are multiple forms of RTI/FOI frameworks operating in this country—for example, for different branches of government or types of agency—please explain this briefly in the existence summary box and assess here the **form with the broadest coverage**. If there are significant differences in how you would assess other common forms of RTI performance data frameworks, please explain in the summary box.
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses availability of RTI performance data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.

    	- Regional analysis such as AFIC's [State of Right of access to Information in Africa Report](https://africafoicentre.org/ati-in-africa/) (currently through 2017).
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Government officials who handle appeals to denials of public records requests, in order to obtain a sense of the conditions in which an agency denies (or grants) information.
    
    	- Officers of civil society organization with expertise in access-to-information issues.
    
    	- Journalists who report on government transparency or who use RTI/FOI requests as part of their practice.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is the framework governing RTI/FOI performance data provided for in law**,** regulation, policy, or guidance?  
    
    - Does the framework require that basic performance and administrative data about the RTI/FOI process—such as number of requests submitted and filled—be both collected and published?
    
    - Does the framework require that agencies, either individually or through a unified system, not only track how long it takes them to fulfill RTI/FOI requests, but also publish that information?
    
    - Does the framework require agencies not only to track when and why material is withheld from requesters—either partially or in full—but also to publish that information? 
    
    - Does the framework require agencies not only to track appeals to RTI/FOI determinations and their results, but also to publish that information?
    
    - Does the framework require that published RTI/FOI performance and administrative data be linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity?
    
    - Does the framework empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data? Does it require a verification process?
    
    - Does the framework cover the entire public sector? Does it cover the national government, but not certain positions, agencies, or branches? Does it only apply to certain levels of government?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Right-to-information practices are a key part of transparency and accountability initiatives that support members of a public in assessing whether and how consistently public officials use political power for the common good. This right to access the information that public authorities hold is recognized by the special mandates for the UN, OSCE, and OAS and connects directly with SDG 16.10.
    
    When RTI practices function well, they support oversight, reduce information asymmetries, and open a dialogue between members of the public and public officials. However, the quality, comprehensiveness, and attention to performance of these laws vary. Further, in practice a host of obstacles may impede the right to information laid out by legislation, such as slow response times, inappropriate use of exemptions, difficulties in contesting decisions—even lack of appropriate staffing and technical expertise among the relevant records officers can be a critical de facto impediment.
    
    Elsewhere we investigate RTI frameworks themselves. This indicator instead investigates the frameworks countries have in place for collecting and publishing data on the performance of RTI processes.
