=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    The overall socio-economic, economic, political, cultural progress of a country is dependent on population data to a large extent. Most Governments use Census (usually every 10 years) to count their population. As defined by the United Nations Statistics Division (2017: 186), “In the broadest sense, the total [population] may comprise either all usual residents of the country or all persons present in the country at the time of the census. The total of all usual residents is generally referred to as the de jure population and the total of all persons present as the de facto population.”
    
    For the period between census takings, information collected from representative sample surveys can be used to provide population information. National, regional or state/province representative sample surveys collect population information on individuals and/or households. Household surveys on agricultural production, manpower, health, migration, housing, and transportation usually collect information on the characteristics of the population. Demographic information may be gathered from a number of different sources, including:
    
    - A continuous population register: an integrated Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system or population registers such as births, marriage and death registers;
    - Administrative systems such as tax records, of databases for administration of social programmes;
    - Population surveys based on a sample of the overall population;
    - Novel data collection approaches such as estimates derived from remote sensing or big data.
    
    These data can be used for planning purposes. Government ministries, statistics offices, and universities are all excellent resources to learn of available surveys.

    - **Search:**
        - The website of the National Statistical Agency for details of census data collection, as well as general population statistics of the country.
        - Latest population surveys conducted by central or local public administrative units.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - National experts in demography, population data and migration: ask about limitations of population data in the country, particularly about the disaggregation by migration status.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on the dataset to check the variety of population data included. 
    
    Look for evidence of:
    
    - **Population total:** check for details on the de facto number of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. This data is used for comparing two or more census counts  for the same country/location for short-term/long-term planning purposes.
    - **Population projections:** check population projection data, which should provide information of what the future size and structure of the population by sex and age might look like in the future, in the country. Optional: check on whether the projections serve as a basis for long-term thinking/planning by the Government and provide any relevant evidence.
    - **Population data desegregated** by gender, age, place of birth, residence, migrant status, education, income and occupation: check the degree to which population data is disaggregated. Is the data set fully disaggregated?
    - **Coverage of population data**: Check whether there is a national government provided or supported source that aggregates together data from sub-national units;
    - Dashboards and other public analytic tools may help you to assess the comprehensiveness and coverage of the population data.
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Focus on **national government** level and assess whether:
    
    - National primary population data is collected directly by central government body/ies via sources such as national census, continuous population register (SRVS), sample surveys, administrative records, other methods;
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     “Reliable, accessible and timely population data are essential for development planning and assessing progress toward the achievement of the new Sustainable Development Agenda”, UN Commission on Population and Development, April 11, 2016. About a third of 231unique SDG indicators provide population data.
     
     Given the relevance of this indicator for migration sector, it is important to mention that SDG indicator 10.7.2, “Number of countries with policies to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people” aims to describe the state of national migration policies and how such policies change over time. Objective 1 of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, expresses the collective commitment of the member states towards collecting and utilizing accurate and disaggregated data as a basis for evidence based policies, with specific actions ensuring improvement of migration data: “migration data collection, analysis and dissemination is accurate, reliable, comparable, disaggregated by sex, age, migration status and other characteristics relevant in national contexts, while upholding the right to privacy under international human rights law and protecting personal data.”
     
     Capturing and making good use of demographic data for sustainable development is key. Availability of accurate and reliable information about a country’s population is important not only to determine its size and understand other characteristics such as age, sex, residence, education, labor force status, occupation, migration status and other attributes, but is useful as well for policy formulation, evidence-based decision-making, longer term strategic planning of the country. Understanding changes in scale, emerging trends and shifting demographics related to global social and economic transformations, such as migration, helps make sense of the changing world we live in and plan for the future.
     
     Making demographic data available involves a careful balance between providing disaggregated data that can meet a wide range of use cases, and protecting privacy. What is important is for all populations to be included in the data. All data should, wherever possible, be disaggregated in order to accurately describe all populations. Ensuring that data collected are sufficiently disaggregated by the appropriate dimensions such as those listed under this indicator, enables more effective interventions and supports policies and strategies to address the underlying inequities. A significant level of data disaggregation is required to insure *no one is left behind*.
