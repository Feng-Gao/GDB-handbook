=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Different government agencies and non governments institutions collect data and report on traffic crashes, whereas police departments, private and public hospitals, transportation agencies, etc. This kind of data, when structured collected, updated, and available, is a key input to inform policies towards reducing mortality rate as consequence of traffic crashes. 
    
    This data can be made available as statistics, with different categories and level of disaggregation (by region, type of accident, age, gender, etc.), and also can be released in a more granular way, publishing information of every crash registered. This latter way, can also have more or less details on causes and consequences, conditions, or description of people involved. 
    
    To assess this indicator, any of this data kinds is useful, and the difference will be in the level of disaggregation of statistic or columns available in a granular. However, only the latter will be able to receive the highest score in geographical reference element, which needs  latitude and longitude coordinates.
    
    For example, [BarcelonaÂ´s Open Data Portal](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/es/dataset/accidents-gu-bcn/resource/bcfc0866-7e2a-4054-9a93-fb3f371fc5eb) provides detailed data on traffic crashes, as well as the region of [Neiva](https://www.datos.gov.co/Transporte/Muertes-en-accidentes-de-tr-nsito/ffwz-fiy4), in Colombia, through their national Open Data Portal. UK Department of Transport, includes in its road traffic statistics, data [on road accidents](https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/custom-downloads/road-accidents/reports/31276e4c-9c22-432c-9900-5d120129c79c)
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - For OECD countries, [IRTAD road safety database](https://www.itf-oecd.org/irtad-road-safety-database) shows yearly statistics, and links to each county's source.
    - **Search:**
        - National and local open data portals.
        - National and local statistics offices.
        - Transportation and or health agencies and their open data portals.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Specialists on traffic crashes.
        - Geodata and transport data community.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the various aspects. 
    
    Look for evidence of:
    
    - **Type of accident:** sideswipe collision, T-bone collision, car-pedestrian crash, etc.
    - **Cause(s) of the crash:** speeding, alcohol, bad road conditions, etc.
    - **Road type:** motorways, urban roads, etc.
    - **Type of** r**oad user:** pedestrians, cyclists, car occupants, etc.
    - **Age** of people involved
    - **Gender** of people involved
    - **Seat position in the car of** people involved
    - **Consequences of the crash:** fatalities, injuries, etc.
    - **Post crash care:** What kind of support did people involved received? How long did they last to get there?
    - **Safety data:** What safety elements were used, such as helmets or seatbelts? Which safety features did the vehicles have?
    - **Geospatial reference of the crash:** Look for the most precise reference. Province, regional, or neighborhood, or latitude and longitude references.
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    If there is no evidence of road traffic accidents data being available at the national level, but there is a strong example of data availability from a sub-national government, or a specific agency, you may carry out an assessment for this data, and use the extent question to note that this only covers a very limited number of road traffic accidents.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5â29 years and approximately 1.35 million people die each year as a consequence of traffic crashes, while between 20 and 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries. These events cost to some countries 3% of their gross domestic product. As with other phenomena, this connects with development status: more than 90% of fatal crashes occur in low- and middle-income countries, although they have only approximately 60% of the world's vehicles  ([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries)).
     
     SDG 3, on good health and well-being, includes target 3.6, which seeks to reduce global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents. This goal was framed by UN General Assembly resolution 74/299 on "Improving global road safety;" further, the General Assembly proclaimed 2021â2030 the Decade of Action for Road Safety ([WHO](https://www.who.int/groups/united-nations-road-safety-collaboration/decade-of-action-for-road-safety-2021-2030)).
     
     Accurate, updated, and detailed data on traffic crashes is key to informing and shaping policies to reduce road mortality. However, a great number of countries lack accurate and accessible data about traffic crashes, particularly low-income countries that need it the most to improve policies to reduce mortality [(World Bank)](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/finding-missing-data-creating-actionable-information-solving-development-problems?cid=dec_tt_data_en_ext#_ftn1).
