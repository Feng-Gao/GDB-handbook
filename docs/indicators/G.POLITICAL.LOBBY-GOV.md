# Governance: Lobbying register

The survey asks the question: To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on lobbying activities?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    While there are considerable differences in how lobbying activities are defined for reporting purposes—a key impediment to studying lobbying comparatively—there’s widespread consensus on the underlying concept of lobbying. Here we use the [International Standards for Lobbying Regulation](https://lobbyingtransparency.net/standards/regulatory-scope/)’s definition: lobbying includes “any direct or indirect communication with a public official that is made, managed, or directed with the purpose of influencing public decision-making;” moreover, as their guidance notes, “a lobbying definition should address commonly known forms of lobbying, where a lobbyist enters into direct contact with a public official, but it should also cover indirect lobbying activities, for example, where lobbyists mobilize other stakeholders to represent their views or hire consultancy firms to do lobbying work on their behalf.”
    
    Increasingly, governments at different levels are establishing frameworks to govern lobbying.  Typically these take the form of lobbying registers. Lobbying registers track who engages in and with lobbying, how, and when. 
    
    Not all of the lobbying actors need be located in that country. If a lobbyist in country A lobbies a local official in country A on behalf of a company located in country B, then lobbying registers in both country A and country B may in theory be expected to contain details of that activity. 
    
    This indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:
    
    - Lobbying register data is collected and maintained as **structured data** across the whole country
    - Lobbying registers contain structured data on the activities of **lobbyists, clients,** and **public officials**
    - Lobbying registers include a **verification process**
    - Lobbying registers are **regularly updated** in a manner that is **timely** and **responsive** to lobbying activities
    - Lobbying registers are **published**
    
    Verification of lobbying activities may be accomplished through various methods. One method involves cross-verification of registers kept by lobbyists and public officials; another empowers an agency or official with an investigative or enforcement mandate.
    
    Note that in the case of lobbying, it's possible for a framework to require regular updates without those updates being timely or responsive to lobbying activities. For example, if a framework requires updates every year, those updates may be regular but not sufficiently responsive to specific lobbying activities to offer insights into which lobbyist clients may have influenced a public official's stance on a policy.
    
    If there are multiple forms of lobbying registers operating under different frameworks, you should **focus your assessment on the most common domestic form.**
    
    If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other common forms of lobbying registers, please briefly comment on this in the free text justification.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - High Authority for Transparency in Public Life's [comparative study of lobbying regulation mechanisms](https://www.hatvp.fr/english_news/comparative-study-of-lobbying-regulation-mechanisms/#); this covers 41 jurisdictions, primarily European but with examples from elsewhere around the world as well, with sources; from October 2020
        - The [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/policy-area/lobbying/) commitments on lobbying offer an overview of lobbying commitments and their implementation made by various countries and cities (currently 21 in number).
        - This [2014 report from the OECD](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/lobbyists-governments-and-public-trust-volume-3_9789264214224-en#page1) reviewed the implementation of the OECD's 2010 principles for transparency and integrity in lobbying; chapter 3 in particular examines lobbying disclosures across OECD countries.
    
    - **Search:**
        - For recent updates to lobbying laws in the country.
        - The website(s) of the country's lobbying registration agency or agencies for details of how they collect and manage data, and the basis of this in law or regulation.
        - For examples of current forms used to register lobbying activities.
        - For lobbying databases constructed by journalists or country-relevant NGOs that coordinate multiple streams of lobbying data; among other information, these may contain details on known gaps in this law or regulation.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Investigative journalists who focus on corruption and integrity issues in the country
        - Local officials of civil society organizations focused on transparency and accountability in governance
        - Lobbyists
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is the framework for disclosure and verification of lobbying activities provided for in **law**, ****through **regulation**, or through **policy**?
    - Does the framework focus on **lobbyists**, lobbying **transactions**, or both?
    - Does the framework provided unambiguous definitions of lobbying activities, or is there a pattern of confusion or disagreement about what constitutes a lobbying activity?
    - Does the framework require this information to be managed as structured data?
    - Does the framework require this information to be verified in some way?
    - Does the framework specify that information should be updated in a manner that is timely and responsive to lobbying activities?
    - If data from the lobbying register is publicly available, is this on a legal basis? Or could government choose to remove access to the data at any time?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries lobbying registers have been established by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    This indicator is concerned with whether there is a framework that will support access to data about **all lobbying activities** in a country. This might be achieved by:
    
    - Having a minimum set of practices and standards that lead to data collection across all sub-national units; and
    - A framework that provides for aggregation of data from different sub-national units into a national database.
    
    To assess countries where lobbying registers are organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier or an example of widespread practice. 
    
    Researchers should comment on whether a framework exists either to aggregate data from sub-national registers, or to provide this data in interoperable formats.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     In recent years lobbying has become an area of increasing regulation, with a priority placed on understanding who specifically lobbies. Thus, regulations typically require some form of lobbying register. Depending on how registers are construed, they may include not only identities of lobbyists but also transaction data regarding meetings, briefs, and gifts. Such registers ground a great deal of new empirical research (see, e.g., Bombardini and Trebbi 2020; de Figueiredo and Richter 2014) on lobbying. At the same time, they have gaps: different definitions of what requires reporting, sometimes within the same level of government (e.g., Mexico); more or less stringent sanction and cross-verification practices; differing capabilities for surfacing grassroots lobbying.
