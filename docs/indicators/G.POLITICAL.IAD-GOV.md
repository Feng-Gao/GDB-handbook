# Governance: Asset declarations

The survey asks the question: To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on the interests and assets of public officials?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Most countries around the world have some requirement that public officials declare their interests and assets. Some such requirements are motivated by a desire to avoid conflicts of interest, some to eliminate illicit enrichment, while others combine elements of the two. Here we include elements of both.
    
    There is substantial variance in whose interests and assets must be disclosed. Some frameworks only require public officials who hold specific positions to make financial disclosures, some require all public officials. Some frameworks limit disclosures to the interests and assets under the direct control of the public official alone, some require disclosures of interests and assets belonging to partners, family members, or other intimates.
    
    This indicator is based on the presence and strength of legislation, regulations, or policies that govern whether:
    
    - Interest and asset data is collected and maintained as **structured data** across the whole country.
    - Financial disclosures contain structured data on **income**, **spending**, **assets**, ****and **debts**.
    - Declarations cover both **financial** (income, assets, and liabilities) and **non-financial** (e.g., employment, memberships) interests.
    - Declarations are ****updated in a timely fashion; this includes both **regular updates** and updates that are **responsive to changes in position or significant changes in assets and liabilities.**
    - Financial disclosures are **published.**
    - Declarations must also disclose interests and assets held by a **public official's partner, family members, or other intimates**.
    - **Conflict-of-interest training** is required for public officials.
    - A mandate ****is given to an **independent agency or institution** to examine declarations and/or investigate violations.
    - Sanctions for violations are enforceable and proportional.
    - The disclosure process and its publication are available in the official, national, or major languages of a country.
    - The disclosure process and its publication are accessible to screen readers, call relays, and similar devices.
    
    If there are multiple forms of interest and asset declaration requirements operating under different frameworks, you should **focus your assessment on the most common domestic form.**
    
    If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other common forms of declarations, please briefly comment on this in the free text justification.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The World Bank's [Public Accountability Mechanisms](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/public-accountability-mechanisms) offers information on countries' financial disclosure and conflict of interest provisions in law and practice; broader contextual information can also be found in the [2009 report](https://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/Publications/StAR/StAR_Publication_-_Income_and_Asset_Declarations.pdf) of their collaboration with StAR.
        - The World Bank's [Financial Disclosure Law Library](https://publicofficialsfinancialdisclosure.worldbank.org/).
        - OGP's database of country commitments regarding [asset disclosure](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/policy-area/asset-disclosure/).
    
    - **Search:**
        - For recent updates to financial disclosure laws in the country.
        - The website(s) of the country's ethics or integrity agency or agencies for details of how they collect and manage data, and the basis of this in law or regulation.
        - For examples of current forms used to register financial disclosures, to certify divestitures, to make ethics pledges.
        - For announcements of conflict-of-interest trainings that may include details on legal or regulatory requirements.
        - For interest and asset databases constructed by journalists or country-relevant NGOs that coordinate multiple streams of financial data; among other information, these may contain details on known gaps in the country's laws or regulations.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Investigative journalists who focus on corruption and integrity issues in the country.
        - Local officials of civil society organizations focused on transparency and accountability in governance.
        - Officials of governmental ethics or public integrity offices.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is the framework for disclosure and verification of interests and assets provided for in law, ****through regulation, or through policy?
    - Does the framework require financial disclosures from all public officials, or only officials or nominees to particular positions?
    - Does the framework require financial disclosures from a public official's partner, family members, or other intimates?
    - Does the framework take an adversarial approach, focused on preventing illicit enrichment, or does it work more collaboratively to prevent conflicts of interest?
    - Does the framework require publication of financial disclosures? Is access to financial disclosures restricted; for example, by providing disclosures only upon request or allowing only in-person review of a paper archive?
    - Does the framework require this information to be managed as structured data?
    - Does the framework require this information to be verified in some way?
    - Does the framework specify that information should be updated at regular intervals but also in a manner that is timely and responsive to changes in employment?
    - If data from financial disclosures is publicly available, is this on a legal basis? Or could the government choose to remove access to the data at any time?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, frameworks that govern interest and asset declarations may be established primarily by individual states, regions, or cities. To assess such countries, researchers should select the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Interest and asset declarations, sometimes referred to as wealth declarations or financial disclosures, have been used since at least 1960, when the Philippines passed its Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act requiring public officials to declare under oath their assets and liabilities at the beginning and end of their terms in office (Apostol n.d.). In 2003, the adoption of the UN Convention Against Corruption, which includes strong declaration practices, sparked a renewed focus on the declaration as an accountability mechanism. A World Bank study published in 2016 found that 161 of 176 countries had some form of interest and asset declaration, though these showed significant variation (Rossi, Pop, and Berger 2016).
