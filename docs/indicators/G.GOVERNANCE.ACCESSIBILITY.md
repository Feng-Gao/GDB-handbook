# Governance: Accessibility & data

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance ensure the inclusion of people with disabilities with regard to data? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator investigates the inclusion of persons with disabilities in key data practices. 
    
    Ensuring that data practices are accessible to persons with disabilities can take many forms. For example, this may include*: 
    
    - Laws that mandate that government processes for providing consent for data sharing or for correcting data be accessible to persons with disabilities; 
    
    - Policies that recognize an individual’s right to request accessibility accommodations when the government collects data; 
    
    - Regulations that require universal design principles be implemented in digital public infrastructure;
    
    - Policies that direct data portals to publish datasets and accompanying materials in formats compatible with assistive technologies, such as screen readers;
    
    - Laws that establish cross-government review processes to make sure government websites follow [WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/) or other standards.
    
    *This list is not exhaustive.
    
    **Note:** Mandates that only require collecting data *about* persons with disabilities are insufficient to answer this indicator. Rather, this indicator aims to assess to what extent the government empowers persons with disabilities to be active participants in data communications, collection, and publication. 
    
    **Examples**
    
    - In the UK, the Public Sector Bodies ([Websites and Mobile Applications](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps\#meeting-accessibility-requirements)) Accessibility Regulations 2018 mandate that public sector websites and mobile apps to meet the WCAG 2.1 AA (and [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) from October 2024\) accessibility standard, ensuring that they are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Additionally, organizations must publish and regularly update an [accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement) on their websites. The regulations build on existing obligations under the Equality Act 2010, ensuring that public sector digital services are inclusive and accessible to all, including those using assistive technologies.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Some countries may have frameworks that explicitly address the inclusion of persons with disabilities in data communications, collection, or publication. 
    
    Other countries may have a broader framework that requires the government to make information and services accessible to persons with disabilities, which can be inferred to apply to data communications, collection, and publication. In this circumstance, you’ll need to spot check that the broader framework is indeed being applied to data concerns in practice and explain in the relevant summary box.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- Government websites for "accessibility requirements" and similar terms.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Government officials who serve in communications roles.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following question:
    
    - Are there laws, policy, or guidance that explicitly address the inclusion of persons with disabilities with regard to data? Are there laws, policy, or guidance that implicitly cover such inclusion, and if so, do spot checks confirm that these are being followed with regard to data?
    
    - Does the framework address the inclusion of persons with disabilities in communications about data matters—such as breach notifications, the provision of consent, etc.? 
    
    - Does the framework address the inclusions of persons with disabilities when the government collects data? Validates data with members of the public? For example, do national statistics offices, census bureaus, or other agencies have accessibility mandates that apply to collecting data from members of the public?
    
    - Does the framework address the inclusion of persons with disabilities with regard to government publication of data and data tools? For example, are there requirements that data portals and other digital public infrastructure be accessible to persons with disabilities?

    * **The framework requires a verification process regarding communicating about, collecting, and publishing data in ways that support the inclusion of people with disabilities.** (No, Partially, Yes)
     *There are many different kinds of verification processes. Some processes are automated, some involve direct human review, some combine the two. For example, in some cases, a dedicated agency or official has the authority to conduct audits to verify accessibility compliance; in other cases, the accessibility of specific aspects of digital government, such as digital public infrastructure, might be verified via periodic use of an automated tool assessing compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. For countries with only a broader mandate that requires verification of inclusion, look for performance reports to spot check whether verification processes have engaged with data communications, collection, or publication; answer “Partially” for spot checks that do not find inclusion in practice; answer “Yes” for spot checks that do.*

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    The inclusion of persons with disabilities is critical to making data practices more equitable, making data meaningfully available, and producing high quality data. 
    
    The accessibility of communications about data issues—which can range from providing consent to receiving breach notifications, from seeking correction or redress to providing feedback on data catalogs—affect how well the people involved can participate. Similarly, in data collection, the accessibility of collection tools and practices has consequences for both meaningful consent and data quality. In data publication, the accessibility of how data and its accompanying tools and materials are published affects who can use that data.
    
    Grounded in the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-persons-disabilities) and the [Policy Guidelines for Inclusive Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Disability/SDG-CRPD-Resource/Foundations/policy-guideline-foundations-final.pdf) (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 2020), particularly in conjunction with SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) and SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), this indicator examines to what extent the government empowers persons with disabilities to be active participants in data communications, collection, and publication.
