# Governance: Open data policy

To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a comprehensive framework for generating and publishing open data? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    A framework for open (government) data may take the form of law, regulation, policy, or guidance. It will commit the government to making non-sensitive, government-held data available for reuse both **legally** (e.g., through licenses and terms of use) and **technically **(e.g., through providing data in machine-readable formats). 
    
    Open data frameworks may exist on their own or as part of broader data strategies or policies. 
    
    For more about open data, [consult the Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/).
    
    **Examples**
    
    - [Korea's 2013 Act](https://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EA%B3%B5%EA%B3%B5%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%84%B0%EC%9D%98%EC%A0%9C%EA%B3%B5%EB%B0%8F%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%99%9C%EC%84%B1%ED%99%94%EC%97%90%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%EB%B2%95%EB%A5%A0) promotes open data access by mandating institutions to provide open data and ensuring its generation and publication. The Act defines open data (Article 2), requires adherence to data standards for quality control (Articles 22 and 23), and mandates publication in machine-readable formats (Articles 2 and 24). It also encourages the development of a strong public data use culture by empowering both institutions and users (Article 25).
      
    - [The Australian Government Public Data Policy](https://www.finance.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-10/aust\_govt\_public\_data\_policy\_statement.pdf) outlines requirements for generating and publishing open data. It mandates data be published in machine-readable, spatially-enabled formats while ensuring security, privacy, and commercial confidentiality. It also requires data to be accessible via free, user-friendly, high-quality APIs.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Check the currency of any open data frameworks to confirm they remain active and are being implemented.

    	- The [qualitative data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kugw1mJGsZ7j0gsUxog32qG2aKc-EsIHYxRKX8-Xac/edit) from the Open Data Barometer provides details of policies and strategies identified prior to 2017 generally, prior to 2019 for Latin America and the Caribbean; look for sheets with primary data on ODB context and impact and filter by question ID "ODB.2015.C2."
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- General searches for: "Open data policy," "data strategy," "open data strategy."
    
    	- Search academic search engines (e.g., [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), etc.) for recent papers on "open data" + [country].
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Open data advocates and experts.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Are there laws, regulations, policies, and guidance that provide a comprehensive framework for generating and publishing open data?
    
    	- What is their nature?
    
    	- Do they include a common definition of "open data"?
    
    	- Do they promote open licenses?
    
    	- Do they require machine readability as part of open data?
    
    	- Do they require the use of data standards?
    
    	- Do they promote data training and capacity-building among public officials?

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Promoting the reuse of public data is central to realizing the potential of data for the public good. Open data laws, policies, or strategies provide the framework within which government data can be made available as a resource for third parties to work with.
    
    The Open Data Barometer's 2017 Leaders Edition included an indicator (ODB.2015.C.POLI) which asked the question "To what extent is there a well-defined open data policy and/or strategy?" This indicator is designed to provide comparable data to the ODB indicator. It converts the guidance from the ODB's 0–10 scoring system to element checklist items that should yield similar scoring for similar situations. It reflects the GDB's assumption that governance frameworks based in law are preferable to frameworks based in policy alone.
