# Capability: Civil service training

To what extent is the government providing training to develop civil servants' data literacy and data skills? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Public servants are key players in ensuring that data is used for public good, with institutional readiness to govern, work with, and publish or share data depending significantly on the involvement of motivated and skilled public servants. 
    
    Public servants in data-centered positions should have strong data skills, while public servants in more general positions should meet at least a minimum level of data literacy. Achieving this requires regular and ongoing training opportunities to develop and maintain data skills and literacy.
    
    This indicator focuses on different training activities that governments may undertake to train public servants; these may involve teaching the basics for working with data or improving already existing capacities. Training activities may take place within particular agencies or through cross-cutting programs for all public servants; they may be delivered through online platforms, shared lectures, and so on. 
    
    **Examples**
    
    - In Estonia, the[ State Shared Service Center](https://rtk.ee/finantsarvestus-ja-personaliteenus/personaliarendus/koolitus-ja-arendustegevused) provides data skills training for public sector employees throughout the country; topics include personal data processing, data literacy, data management for local government, implementing data science projects, etc.
    
    - Bulgaria’s [Institute of Public Administration](https://www.ipa.government.bg/en) offers civil servants from central, regional, and local levels centralized professional development in data skills. Topics in the IPA [catalog](https://www.ipa.government.bg/sites/default/files/katalog_ipa_2024_final_en.pdf) include personal data protection, the data regulatory framework in context, statistical literacy, and others.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Start by identifying the public employment or public service national agency, and check whether it mentions training in a general sense and data-related training more specifically. You can also check for e-government or innovation institutions that may lead data training in the country.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- Public service national agency;
    
    	- Documents and laws describing national data strategies.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Data literacy experts;
    
    	- Scholars and officers of civil society organizations working in topics such as e-government, state modernization, data for public good, etc.;
    
    	- Public servants.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there evidence of government´s actions to train civil servants on data matters? If there is such evidence, are training activities isolated efforts or part of a wider strategy?
    
    - Do data training efforts target a general audience of public servants or do they focus only on data scientists and others who already work intensively with data?
    
    - What topics does this training address?
    
    	- Data protection, including laws, policies, and guidelines for managing individual and community privacy;
    
    	- Data gathering, or how to collect data in order to be able to use it effectively;
    
    	- Data management, such as relevant practices for documentation, the use of technical standards, and validating data quality;
    
    	- Data sharing, including practices for sharing data both within the government and with external actors;
    
    	- Data analysis and understanding the limitations of datasets;
    
    	- Data publication, or how to make data publicly accessible and available for reuse, both directly by human users and by programmatic means, while maintaining appropriate safeguards;
    
    	- Technical tools for working with data;
    
    	- Artificial intelligence, including critical literacy topics such as AI limitations and biases; legal concerns of AI datasets; environmental, human rights, and social impact assessments of algorithmic decision-making systems; etc.
    
    - In what context are these trainings delivered?
    
    	- Are they run by an established government training department that works with various subjects, including data?
    
    	- Are they available thanks to a partnership with an external institution, such as a university, civil society organization, or international organization?
    
    	- Are they isolated trainings run by an external provider?
    
    	- Do public servants receive a certification when completing training or is there some other formal recognition of the training as professional development?
    
    - How widespread are these trainings in terms of agencies and ministries?

=== "Indicator Justification"
    
    Data literacy for public servants is a precondition for governments working toward using data for public good. The World Bank's 2021 Data for Better Lives highlights civil servants' data skills as a key component for effective data governance, stating that "institutions can only carry out their roles effectively if their staff are capable of and willing to use good data to undertake their core operations, inform policies, and deliver services... Governing data thus requires a strong technical capacity and investments in human capital development for those who collect, process, analyze, and use data to support evidence-based policy making, core government operations, and service delivery"([World Bank 2021](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2021)).
    
    Similarly, the OECD notes that skilled and motivated public servants are the foundation for an effective and sustainable open data policy, and key for achieving a data-driven public sector that governs and manages data as a strategic asset to create public value ([OECD 2020](https://web-archive.oecd.org/2020-03-10/547558-ourdata-index-policy-paper-2020.pdf)).
    
    For data literacy, public servants need ongoing training, either to learn basic skills to effectively govern, manage, and share data, or to improve and update existing skills. Training programs, therefore, should target different audiences among government officials: some should focus more broadly on civil servants who work with different types of content, while other should focus on improving the skills of those in data-specific positions.
