# Capability: Literacy: Integrity & accountability data

The survey asks the question: To what extent are there dedicated capacity-building programs to improve data literacy among anti-corruption and accountability organizations, including media, civil society, government ethics offices, and independent institutions?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Simply generating and publishing integrity and accountability data isn't sufficient to make it useful and usable—for data to be both useful and usable, there need to be people who are equipped with the knowledge and tools to use it. 
    
    Literacy programs and other forms of capacity-building may be run by, and addressed to, various communities, professions, localities, and populations.
    
    This indicator examines the extent to which there exist dedicated efforts to improve knowledge and skills around integrity and accountability data.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - Websites and social media of civil society organizations that handle integrity and accountability data for formal webinars or training programs in using the data, or informal invitations to collaborate through "citizen science" type programs.
        - Hackathons or programming "boot camps" that feature integrity and accountability datasets.
        - Course catalogs of colleges and universities, as well as local community education systems for classes that involve understanding and using integrity and accountability data.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Journalists who use integrity and accountability data in their reporting, about both what they know of training that is currently available and where they received their own training.
        - Officers of civil society organizations who use integrity and accountability data.
        - Researchers and teachers in the fields of political science, government, law, business, computer science, data science, critical data studies, and education.
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries literacy programs and capacity-building efforts are unevenly distributed, either because they have been established by individual states, regions, or cities, or because they are associated with particular centers of education or civic activity.
    
    To assess countries where training efforts are unevenly distributed, researchers should select the strongest examples of practice, and then indicate how widespread of a practice these examples are.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     SDG 16 calls for governments around the world to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development; provide access to justice for all; and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels," with targets 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, and 16.10 focusing on specific matters of integrity and accountability. Similarly, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) commits countries to combat corruption in both the public and private sectors.
     
     Data about political finance, procurement, company information, land ownership, and similar matters can be useful tools for combating corruption and ensuring accountability—tools, moreover, that when made publicly available can be used by a range of actors, including journalists, civil society organizations, government ethics offices, and independent institutions. However, generating such data isn't in and of itself sufficient—for actors to meaningfully use data, they must also have sufficient data capabilities and skills.
