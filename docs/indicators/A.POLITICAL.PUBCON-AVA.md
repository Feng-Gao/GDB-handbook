The survey asks the question: To what extent is public consultation information available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Increasingly, countries draw on public consultation processes to inform law- and rulemaking. In practice, not all implementations of these processes have lived up to expectations. This indicator focuses specifically on the availability of data that public consultation processes for executive **rulemaking**—including regulations, bylaws, and rules, sometimes known collectively as secondary legislation—generate.
    
    Such data includes the relevant regulations and comments themselves as well as administrative data regarding the performance of a country's public consultation processes. Such administrative data may be required by law or simply provided by governments as part of good practice. 
    
    To assess the performance of a public consultation process, data should include notice of intent, comments, and the various drafts of the regulation under consultation, as well as information on: number of comments submitted; the provision of reasoned responses; and challenges to regulations that have undergone public consultation processes and the results of these challenges.
    
    **Note:** Countries may also use public consultation processes in conjunction with parliamentary legislation or proposed projects, particularly extractive projects with likely environmental impacts. If your country doesn't use public consultation processes in conjunction with regulatory matters, but does for projects or parliamentary legislation, please explain this briefly in the free text justification and assess here the dataset that applies to project-based or legislative public consultation.
    
    In some countries, national public consultation processes for rulemaking are run through a unified system, while in others such processes are run by individual executive agencies. If there are multiple forms of public consultation processes operating under different frameworks, you should **focus your assessment on the most common domestic form.** 
    
    If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other common forms of public consultation processes, please briefly comment on this in the free text justification.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - Reports published by a broader registrar's office, reports from individual agencies that engage with public consultation processes. (Note: some countries provide different sets of data through a broader registrar's office and individual agencies.)
        - National statistical offices or the appropriate governmental agency that houses statistical information.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Government officials who manage public consultation processes for their agency or department.
        - Officers of civil society organizations that actively mobilize public comments.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **How is the data organized?** Is there a docket or similar mechanism for coordinating disparate types of data all related to the same piece of regulation?
    - **What information does the data provide?** For example, does it include notice of intent, proposed regulations, public comments, reasoned responses, final regulations and justification, challenges?
    - **Are the comments available for downloading in bulk?** For example, through an API or other mechanism?
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?
    - **Is there evidence that the availability of this data was affected by COVID-19?**
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries public consultation processes have been established by individual states, regions, or cities, and consequently administrative data about their performance may be published at various levels of government.
    
    To assess countries where public consultation processes are organized sub-nationally, researchers should analyze the administrative data associated with the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Fundamental to democracy is the authority of the public and the involvement of the public in the act of governing, through voting as well as other forms of political participation. Public participation is well-recognized under international law as a fundamental human right, articulated in detail, for example, by the UN OHCHR in *Guidelines for States on the Effective Implementation of the Right To Participate in Public Affairs* (2018). Increasingly, as the OECD’s 2020 *Innovative Citizen Participation and New Democratic Institutions: Catching the Deliberative Wave* details, such political participation includes public consultation in law- or rulemaking processes. Public consultation on law- or rulemaking aligns with SDG 16.7, and is a component within Transparency International’s decision-making dimension of political integrity.
     
     As with right-to-information frameworks, public consultation frameworks fundamentally govern flows of information between members of a public and public officials. Similarly as well, it's important to collect and publish performance data on public consultation practices to assess their efficacy.
