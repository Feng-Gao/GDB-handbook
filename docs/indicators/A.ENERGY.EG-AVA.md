# Availability: Energy generation

The survey asks the question: To what extent is information about energy generation available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Data on energy generation should offer details at both a granular and a broader level. Datasets should provide a detailed overview of generation at the level of individual power plants, as well as key characteristics about those power plants, such as age, name, capacity, geolocation, and fuel type. At a broader level, datasets should include a breakdown of energy generated by fuel type, as well as the share of energy generated via renewable sources. 
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use data on energy generation: 
    
    - to use generation data from individual units to improve modeling and planning for clean energy transitions;
    - to track progress toward renewable energy goals;
    - to evaluate potential climate impacts on power plants themselves.
    
    Uses adapted from the [Open Up Guide: Using Open Data To Advance Climate Action](https://open-data-charter.gitbook.io/open-up-guide-using-open-data-to-advance-climate-a/relevant-data-types).
    
    **Note:** Some countries may provide some of this data only at levels broader than individual power plants. Additionally, more granular data about power plants and production of energy may be located in separate datasets from overviews of energy generation by fuel type and the share generated via renewable sources.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The Global Power Plant Database ([overview](https://www.wri.org/publication/global-power-plant-database) and [GitHub](https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database)) can help provide a quick sense of whether data is available in global datasets or perhaps published in detail by countries.
        - The [International Renewable Energy Agency databases](https://irena.org/Statistics/View-Data-by-Topic/Capacity-and-Generation/Country-Rankings) offer information about the share of energy generated from renewable sources in many countries.
        - [Energydata.info](https://energydata.info/about_us) offers a variety of tools and maps of open energy generation data around the world; the tools combine various sources to generate their datasets, but the underlying data sources can be useful for locating datasets relevant to your country if you cannot find them on websites of energy agencies or public utilities.
    
    - **Search:**
        - The website of your national or local energy agency.
        - The websites of relevant public utilities.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Officials in your national or local energy agency or relevant public utilities.
        - Scholars or researchers at civil society organizations who research the energy sector, air pollution, renewable or alternative energy sources, energy efficiency, infrastructure vulnerability, climate change.
        - Community organizers or officers at civil society organizations who work on advocacy for or implementation of renewable energy systems.
        - Journalists who report on the energy sector, climate change, emissions, renewable energy.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - How granular is the information that's available about energy generation? Can you easily find data at the **level of specific power plants**?
    - What kinds of information are readily available about individual power plants? For example, is it possible to easily identify an **individual plant's capacity, fuel source(s), age, or location**?
    - What **kinds of fuels** are being used to generate energy? Is there historical data available that would allow someone to trace how this mix has changed over time?
    - What **share of the energy comes from renewable sources**? Is there historical data available that would allow someone to track how that share has changed over time?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, data about energy generation may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where data about energy generation is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As energy sectors consistently produce some of the largest shares of a country's emissions, data about the generation of energy is important both for improving access and empowering climate action (SDG 13).
