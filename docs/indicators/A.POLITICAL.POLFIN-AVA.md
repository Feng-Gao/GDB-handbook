# Availability: Political finance data

The survey asks the question: To what extent is political finance information available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Political finance datasets should provide a comprehensive overview of the financial state of political parties and political campaigns, including their income, assets, and liabilities. Further, whether financial support comes from donations, membership fees, or public funding, datasets should show clearly from whom political parties and political campaigns raise money, how much money, and how that money is spent. 
    
    Political finance datasets should be available to members of a public for free, have appropriate language coverage, be accessible, and include both regular updates and updates that are responsive to campaign schedules. If verification is not standard across all data, datasets should show which data have been verified and which have not.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use political finance datasets to verify that parties and campaigns are not receiving financial support from any entities that may be banned under the country's laws (often, for example, this includes foreign entities).
    
    More granular details about donations may be located in a separate donations register.
    
    Because countries have different election schedules and this data is responsive to campaigns, if the country you are assessing has not held within the Barometer's period of assessment, please assess data in conjunction with the **most recent major election** and note this in the free text justification.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - The site of the country's relevant oversight agencies, such as its elections commission, registrar of political donates, etc.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Investigative journalists who report on political finance or money in politics more broadly, particularly any who appear to be using aggregate political finance data.
        - Officials of civil society organizations that advocate for transparency and accountability regarding money in politics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **What financial and non-financial information does the data include?** For example, does it include information about financial contributions, income, assets and liabilities, spending, and in kind or non-financial support?
    - **What information about donors and donations does the data include?** For example, does it include not only donation amounts but identifying details of donors, such as names, residence, occupation, employer?
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?
    - **Is there evidence that the availability of this data was affected by COVID-19?**
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, political finance data may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where administrative data about violence against women is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) calls for transparency regarding the role of money in politics.
     
     While donating to a politician or political cause is widely considered a form of political participation, there is also widespread concern about the effects of money in politicsâ€”with particular questions regarding who donates to parties and campaigns, how much, and how that affects political outcomes. 
     
     Transparent campaign and party financing is thus critical for understanding whose interests shape parties, ballot initiatives, and the decisions of specific public officials.
