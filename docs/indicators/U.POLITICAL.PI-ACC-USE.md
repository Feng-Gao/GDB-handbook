The survey asks the question: To what extent is there evidence of political integrity data being used to identify, expose, or highlight failures of government?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Political integrity data offers key tools for public oversight of governance processes and officials. When political integrity data is available, actors both inside and outside government have greater opportunities to identify, expose, and highlight failures of government, for example:
    
    - Journalists might use political integrity data to trace financial flows across donors, parties, and officials when investigating corrupt networks.
    - Civil society organizations might file amicus briefs opposing the implementation of a specific regulation, citing public participation data as grounds for challenging its legitimacy.
    - Academics might analyze and report on problems in government decision-making, using information obtained through freedom of information requests.
    - Businesses might use lobbying data to identify unfair advantages held by competitors and organize industry-wide responses through relevant professional organizations.
    - Civil society organizations might draw on financial disclosures to generate ethics scorecards for different agencies or officials.
    
    For this indicator, we focus on accountability uses by actors outside government, including media, civil society organizations, academia, private sector, and individual members of the public. We prioritize institutionalized actors, though for lower scores on this metric, accountability uses by individual members of the public (as opposed to members of organized civil society or academia) may also be taken into account. However, for higher scores there should be evidence that the use of data for accountability purposes has become institutionalized.
    
    It is important to note, however, that while we focus this indicator on accountability for failures of government, political integrity data often confirms that officials or electoral candidates or others are maintaining a high standard of integrity—and these, too, are important examples of using political integrity data for accountability purposes, though not the focus of this indicator.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Search:**
        - News media for articles about money in politics, corruption, conflicts of interest, ethics violations by government officials, financial scandals, and lobbying.
        - Websites of local civil society organizations that focus on corruption, transparency, and accountability.
        - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) for examples of academic research drawing on political integrity data.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Journalists who cover government beats or have particular expertise in corruption or financial networks.
        - Officials of civil society organizations that focus on corruption, transparency, or accountability in government, and/or organizations that focus on strengthening participatory democracy.
        - Scholars at local universities who work on money in politics, public participation in government, and RTI.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Focusing in turn on the media, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector, look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does this kind of actor regularly use some form of political integrity data for accountability purposes? Or do they perhaps only use such data infrequently? Or never, as far as you can determine?
    - Do only certain kinds of political integrity data seem to be being used? Are others largely neglected?
    - What kinds of impacts do you see from these uses, and how significant are these impacts?

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Political integrity data is a key tool not only for identifying whose interests shape how governance decisions are made and implemented, but for supporting officials to maintain a high standard of integrity—and providing evidence to hold officials accountable when they fail to do so.
     
     Various actors work to hold officials accountable, including the media, civil society organizations, academia, private sector, and individual members of the public; these actors may mobilize political integrity data in different ways.
     
     Our focus on accountability uses of political integrity data aligns with SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, particularly its targets around rule of law (16.3); transparent, accountable institutions (16.6); responsive, inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making (16.7); and public access to information (16.10).
