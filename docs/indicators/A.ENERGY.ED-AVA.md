# Availability: Electricity distribution

The survey asks the question: To what extent is information about energy distribution available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    The energy industry distinguishes between **distribution**, as the delivery of electricity directly from substations to homes, businesses, and other end users via low-voltage power lines; and **transmission**, as the transfer of electricity from power stations to substations via high-voltage power lines. Consequently, network information typically includes both distribution and transmission data. This indicator is designed to assess data that offers an overview of the capability of electricity infrastructure in providing access to electricity for all; this necessarily involves both distribution and transmission infrastructure, though our focus is on the end user.
    
    Data that reports on energy distribution should provide detailed geospatial information regarding network infrastructure, both that which already exists and that which is planned. It should also include information about disruptions and their causes that speaks to the on-the-ground experience of energy distribution. Along similar lines, and in alignment with widespread efforts to improve gender equity throughout all aspects of the energy sector, data should include fields relevant to understanding gendered aspects of access to energy.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use datasets that report on energy distribution:
    
    - to assess the comprehensiveness of distribution networks, identifying last-mile infrastructure and populations with limited or no access;
    - to support planning grids and micro-grids;
    - to increase understanding of emissions in the energy sector and help assess climate risks and vulnerabilities with regard to the reliability of distribution;
    - to innovate the provision of clean energy;
    - to propose and implement plans to achieve gender equity in access to energy;
    
    While details about networks and disruptions are often found together, gendered aspects of access to energy are often siloed away from traditional distribution data. 
    
    Here, we're looking primarily to identify where data includes fields relevant to gendered aspects of distribution. These might include, for example, sex-differentiated data about micro-grid use or about users experiencing power disruptions, or information about off-grid distribution that speaks to fuel collection and time poverty.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - [Energydata.info](https://energydata.info/about_us) offers a variety of tools and maps of open data on energy transmission and distribution around the world; the tools combine various sources to generate their datasets, but the underlying data sources can be useful for locating datasets relevant to your country if you cannot find them on websites of energy agencies or public utilities.
    
    - **Search:**
        - The website of your national or local energy agency.
        - The websites of relevant public utilities.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Officials in your national or local energy agency or relevant public utility.
        - Scholars or researchers at civil society organizations who research utilities infrastructure, the energy sector, access to energy, time poverty, energy markets in your country.
        - Officers at civil society organizations who work on advocacy for or implementation of decentralized or renewable energy systems.
        - Community organizers who advocate for and work to implement grid extension, electrification, or renewable energy projects within their communities.
        - Journalists who report on the energy sector or fields with overlapping infrastructure concerns such as telecommunications and transportation; climate change and emissions, renewable energy, or fossil fuels; poverty, equity, and energy resources.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Does the data include **geospatial information** about both e**xisting network infrastructure** **and** **plans for future infrastructure**? Often this takes the form of a map that users can use to get an overview of larger networks as well as local views at a more granular level.
    - Does the data only show national networks, or does it also include information about **last-mile distribution**?
    - Is there detailed information available regarding **power outages**, such as **how long they have lasted, where they occurred, and what caused them**?
    - Is data about access and distribution, two fundamentally interlinked concepts, also linked at the level of data availability? Does the **data include fields that might help someone understand the gendered aspects of access**?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Countries as well as sub-national governments may trade energy—exporting energy, importing it, or some mixture of both; if your country's data shows this, please note it in the explanation box.
    
    Additionally, in some countries, data about energy distribution may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where data about energy distribution is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Access to energy, as well as the energy sector more broadly, has wide gender inequities; consequently, the World Bank ([2017](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/463071494925985630/pdf/115066-BRI-P148200-PUBLIC-FINALSEARSFGenderweb.pdf)) and others call for mainstreaming gender throughout energy positions, policies, and data. 
     
     As modern energy systems rely heavily on networked infrastructure, questions of access are fundamentally tied to distribution policies and practices.
     
     Distribution can be understood from a number of angles, each supporting different actors and actions. Geospatial data about network infrastructure offers a view from above that can help users understand coverage gaps or bottlenecks and plan extensions, micro-grids, etc. Data about the reliability of distribution, about power outages and network disruptions, speaks to the on-the-ground experience of that infrastructure and can help users advocate for upgrades, maintenance, and additional infrastructure. Data on access and gender surfaces critical information on the societal aspects of distribution failure and can help users target improvements in distribution practices to address inequitable access and the time poverty it causes.
