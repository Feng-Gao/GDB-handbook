=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    This indicator aims to track a wide range of actions that can be assigned to a consistent strategy from the government to build, maintain and develop a national culture of data re-use:  challenges, hackatons, virtual events, communications strategies, informative sessions, working group and financial programs to support data re-use are some examples.
    
    Governments might support data re-use regarding different kinds of data. Creating communities around and supporting re-use of Open Government Data is a well known aspect of Open Data Strategy, however, nowadays this need extends beyond Open Data, and we aim to cover other kind of dataset, such as private data, crowdsourced data, or working on Big Data in a general way, no matter its source and licences. 
    
    Past ODB editions have registered the following activities to support data re-use. They are focused on Open Government Dara, but help to build a picture of the kind of support that we are looking for:
    
    - [Challenge.gov](http://challenge.gov/) is a US Government website that lists open data challenges and prize competitions. As of July 2016, there were 722 live competitions (1). The challenges and competitions are run by over 75 agencies across federal government (2). According to [challenge.gov](http://challenge.gov/), 640+ competitions have been launched and more than $220 million awarded in prizes since 2010, with participants from every state in the US (2).
    - In cooperation with Cloudera, the government of Singapore  launched [BASE](http://www.opengovasia.com/articles/7049-data-is-the-new-currency-singapore-government-to-invest-s120-milllion-in-ict-and-cloudera-rolls-out-big-analytics-skills-enablement-initiative) (Big Analytics Skills Enablement) initiative, which is aimed to equip workforces from public and private sectors with data analytic skills (4)
    - The [Stuiveling Open Data Award](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2015/05/28/introductie-stuiveling-open-data-award) by the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations is granted annually for 5 years (2016 being the first year of the award) to a public or private party who deploys, promotes or enables open data in helping resolve social issues.
    - In November of 2015 the Ministry of Finance of Finland together with Population Register Center launched the [Data Exchange Layer](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ckeditor_files/files/eGovernmnent%20in%20Finland%20-%20February%202016%20-%2018_00%20-%20v2_00.pdf), which provides a standardized way to exchange information and data between public sector organisations and national datasets. This should make it easier to get cohesive data.
    - In France, Etalab, the national open data initiative, organizes a yearly challenge called [Dataconnexions](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/dataconnexions), where the best data reused are exposed and promoted nationally.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - [ODB](https://opendatabarometer.org/data/4thEdition/ODB-4thEdition-PrimaryData-Context-Impact.csv) notes on question ODB.2013.C7 has relevant information for the year 2016. Some of those programs could still be working, or lead to organizations in charge of these kinds of activities.
    
    - **Search:**
        - Annual reports on Governments activities regarding data.
        - Look for "news and updates" in National and local data portals.
        - Explore updates newsletter from government agencies working with data
        - Join Whatsapp or Telegram groups of data advocates, and forums about these topics.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Relevant people from the Open Data Community.
        - Public officials working with Open Data and or Data in a general sense.
        - Scholars working on the local data agenda.
        - Civil Society Organisations working with data, e-government and relevant topics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is there evidence of a government **strategy to support and encourage data re-use**?
        - Is this evidence from isolated examples, or is it a coherent strategy with long term objectives and plans?
    - Of what **kinds of data** is government supporting re-use? Open government data, private data, crowdsourced data? Or it is just encouraging data sharing no matter its source and licence to build a Big Data working culture?
    - In practice, **how is government supporting this data re-use?** With challenges, working groups, communication efforts, informative sessions, financial aid for data projects?
        - Have these initiatives been affected by COVID-19 pandemic?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    Some countries have data strategies at a national level, which might coordinate efforts with local governments. In others, there might be local support with no national initiatives. Please note these situations at the "extent" component of this indicator.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Having legal frameworks in place and data released for re-use might not be enough for a country to see the outcomes, uses and impacts that deliver use of data for the public good.
     
     Data re-use is not an action that takes place in a vacuum, where actors has mechanical interactions in a single release-use flow: it is a process where stakeholders interacts in different ways, and where constant interactions and feedback take place, to build an ecosystem of interrelations with actors affecting each other.
     
     Therefore, government plans and actions to encourage data re-use is a key component of a country's data strategy towards public good. This indicator tracks what kind of support, if any, governments provide for data-reuse, to create vibrant data ecosystems. 
     
     Moreover, users engagement with data is meant to be a crucial element when talking about sustainability of data policies, since it is a key component to ensure positive outcomes and impacts, that justify policies and initiatives.

     This indicator also provides continuity with ODB.2013.C.SUPIN which asked *"To what extent is government directly supporting a culture of innovation with open data through competitions, grants or other support actions?"*
