# Availability: Lobbying data

To what extent is detailed lobbying information available for public use? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    A lobbying register should include details on lobbyists, lobbying clients, and public officials, and track the contacts and transactions that occur between lobbyists and public officials, including when, with regard to what matters, how much money is expended, and for what goals. A register should include both regular updates and updates that are responsive to lobbying activities. The best lobbying registers are rigorously reviewed and validated, either by an agency with a mandate to investigate reports and sanction violations, through cross-verification of a public official's and lobbyist's records, or both.
    
    Although lobbying scandals occur worldwide, relatively few countries currently have frameworks that govern lobbying activities. The frameworks—and consequently datasets—that do exist appear across levels of government; in some cases multiple frameworks exist at the same level of government.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - In Canada, the [online Registry of Lobbyists](https://lobbycanada.gc.ca/app/secure/ocl/lrs/do/guest?lang=eng) enables the public to search and view detailed reports and statistics on lobbying activities, submitted through registrations and monthly communication reports. The data is easily accessible [through search tools](https://lobbycanada.gc.ca/app/secure/ocl/lrs/do/lbsRegs) and can be downloaded for further analysis.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses governance of lobbying data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:** 
    
    	- Transparency International's [Integrity Watch](https://data.integritywatch.eu/) includes political integrity information for at least seventeen countries in Europe; depending on the country, this may include political finance data, interest and asset information, and lobbying data. Time ranges covered vary by country; for some countries data may no longer be up-to-date, but can still provide a useful starting point. 
    
    	- The [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/11/30/influence-abroad-the-state-of-global-lobbying-disclosure/) assessed the different kinds of databases associated with lobbying registers in 2016; the most right-hand column includes links. (Note: all of the links to the spreadsheet itself are currently inaccessible, but the linked article has an accessible version embedded about halfway through.) 
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- The lobbying register's site for details about data downloads, possible data formats, or APIs.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Investigative journalists who report on lobbying or money in politics more broadly, particularly any who appear to be using aggregate lobbying data.
    
    	- Officials of civil society organizations that advocate for transparency and accountability regarding money in politics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **What information about lobbying activities does the data include?** For example, does it include information about the identity of participants, lobbyists' goals, the date and time of interactions, topics discussed in each interaction, and cost?
    
    - I**s the data not just regularly updated, but updated in a timely manner? **For example, is it updated in response to lobbying activities, quarterly, annually, or on some other schedule?
    
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?

     *In cases where the indicator itself identifies a dataset(s) to assess against—or a separate governance indicator has asked you to determine data requirements of a relevant governing framework—assess against that. In cases where there is no such identified dataset(s) or related governance indicator, please assess based on: the parameters laid out in the publication of the information (e.g., are some fields entirely empty when they shouldn't be?); your local knowledge (e.g., if the data is supposed to include information for all public officials, does the number of total entries seem reasonable?); and any broader research you may have done for this topic (e.g., have media articles decried the incompleteness of this data?). Note: this sub-question examines omissions only of mandated data; so if, for example, laws do not require the reporting of data below certain thresholds, that data is not considered “missing.”*

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    In recent years lobbying has become an area of increasing regulation, with a priority placed on understanding who specifically lobbies. Thus, regulations typically require some form of lobbying register. Depending on how registers are designed, they may include not only identities of lobbyists but also transaction data regarding meetings, briefs, and gifts. Such registers ground a great deal of new empirical research (see, e.g., Bombardini and Trebbi 2020; de Figueiredo and Richter 2014) on lobbying. At the same time, they have gaps: different definitions of what requires reporting, sometimes within the same level of government (e.g., Mexico); more or less stringent sanction and cross-verification practices; differing capabilities for surfacing grassroots lobbying.
    
    To understand both gaps and best practices across the world, this indicator investigates the data on lobbying activities that countries make available.
