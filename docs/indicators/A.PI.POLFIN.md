# Availability: Political finance data

To what extent is detailed political finance information available for public use? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Political finance data should provide a comprehensive overview of the financial state of political parties and political campaigns, including their income, assets, and liabilities. Further, whether financial support comes from donations, membership fees, or public funding, data should show clearly from whom political parties, candidates, and third parties (that is, non-contestants who seek to influence the election result) raise money, how much money, and how that money is spent. 
    
    Political finance data should be available to members of a public for free, have appropriate language coverage, and include both regular updates and updates that are responsive to campaign schedules. If verification is not standard across all data, datasets should show which data have been verified and which have not.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use political finance data to verify that political parties, candidates, and third parties are not receiving financial support from any entities that may be banned under the country's laws (for example, this often includes foreign entities).
    
    **Examples**
    
    - The [Political Parties Financing Surveillance Committee's webpage](https://www.erjk.ee/en/financing-reports/revenues-political-parties) in Estonia offers an interactive interface where users can access comprehensive national political finance data. This dataset includes detailed information on donations, allocations, income, and expenses for each party or candidate. The dataset, updated quarterly, is available in machine-readable formats for easy exploration and download.  
    
    - In Canada, financial data includes detailed records of monetary contributions, loans, transfers, unpaid claims, and loan balances. The [Elections Canada database](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=fin\&lang=e) identifies contributors by type—individuals, corporations, trade unions, and other entities—and connects them to their recipients, whether candidates or political entities. It also provides financial returns and annual statements of assets and liabilities for political parties. 
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    Because countries have different election schedules and this data is responsive to campaigns, if the country you are assessing has not held a major election within the Barometer's period of assessment, please assess data in conjunction with the **most recent major election** and note this in the appropriate summary box.
    
    Frequently, details of campaign accounts and donations will be recorded separately—for example, more granular details about donations may be located in a separate donations register.
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses governance of political finance data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
    
    	- Transparency International's [Integrity Watch](https://data.integritywatch.eu/) includes political integrity information for at least seventeen countries in Europe; depending on the country, this may include political finance data, interest and asset information, and lobbying data. Time ranges covered vary by country; for some countries data may no longer be up-to-date, but can still provide a useful starting point. 
    
    	- For background information about whether a country has laws or regulations providing for public funding of parties or candidates, explore the “public funding” section of IDEA’s [Political Finance Database](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/question?question_id=9212&database_theme=302) (questions 28–37), which covers 181 countries.
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- The site of the country's relevant oversight agencies, such as its elections commission, registrar of political donations, etc.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Investigative journalists who report on political finance or money in politics more broadly, particularly any who appear to be using aggregate political finance data.
    
    	- Officials of civil society organizations that advocate for transparency and accountability regarding money in politics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **What financial and non-financial information does the data include?** For example, does it include information about financial contributions, income, assets and liabilities, spending, and in-kind or non-financial support?
    
    - **What information about donors and donations does the data include?** For example, does it include not only donation amounts but identifying details of donors, such as names, residence, occupation, employer?
    
    - **Who does the data cover?** Does it cover all political parties, candidates, and third parties? Does one of these categories have notable differences with regard to the comprehensiveness of the information available?
    
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the data in front of you and your local knowledge?

    * **Negative scoring:**
    
    * **This information is missing required data.** (There is no evidence of data gaps., There is evidence that a portion of mandated data is missing., There is evidence of widespread omissions in mandated data.)
     *In cases where the indicator itself identifies a dataset(s) to assess against—or a separate governance indicator has asked you to determine data requirements of a relevant governing framework—assess against that. In cases where there is no such identified dataset(s) or related governance indicator, please assess based on: the parameters laid out in the publication of the information (e.g., are some fields entirely empty when they shouldn't be?); your local knowledge (e.g., if the data is supposed to include information for all public officials, does the number of total entries seem reasonable?); and any broader research you may have done for this topic (e.g., have media articles decried the incompleteness of this data?). Note: this sub-question examines omissions only of mandated data; so if, for example, laws do not require the reporting of data below certain thresholds, that data is not considered “missing.”*

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) calls for transparency regarding the role of money in politics. Transparent campaign and party financing is critical for understanding whose interests shape parties, ballot initiatives, and the decisions of specific public officials. Donating to a politician or political cause is widely considered a form of political participation; however, there is also widespread concern about the effects of money in politics—with particular questions regarding who donates to parties and campaigns, how much, and how that affects political outcomes. 
    
    To support political finance transparency efforts, this indicator thus investigates the campaign and party finance data that countries make available.
