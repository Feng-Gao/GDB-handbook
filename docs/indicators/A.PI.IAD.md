# Availability: Interest & asset declarations

To what extent is detailed interest and asset declaration information available for public use? 


    
=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Interest and asset declarations’ data should provide a comprehensive overview of the financial state of all relevant public officials, clearly identifying their interests, assets, and liabilities, as well as gifts they receive. In addition to regular updates, such data should include information on any significant changes in an official's interests, assets, and liabilities—for example, it should be responsive to changes in employment. Declarations data should also use unique identifiers to clearly identify not only the public official but also any partners, family members, or other close associates that the country requires to disclose interests and assets as well.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use declarations data to verify that relevant public officials do not have interests that trigger conflict between their public responsibilities and private identity. Datasets may include information about interests that have been divested or placed in a blind trust or other mechanism designated by the country.
    
    **Examples**
    
    - The Haute Autorité pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique (HATVP) is an independent French authority composed of members appointed by the President, the Conseil d'État, the Court of Audit, the National Assembly, and the Senate. [HATVP's website](https://www.hatvp.fr/consulter-les-declarations/?anchor=open-data\#open-data) provides a user-friendly interface for accessing, downloading, and analyzing data on asset and interest declarations.  

    - In Chile, The Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic and the Council for Transparency provide citizens with access to declarations of interests and assets, including personal property, securities (both domestic and international), and debts exceeding one hundred monthly tax units. This information is available on [a website](https://www.infoprobidad.cl/\#\!/inicio) that is updated weekly and offers data in various open formats (CSV, XML, JSON, SPARQL).
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Note:** This indicator pairs with a related indicator that assesses governance of interest and asset data in order to compare frameworks and actual practice. While completing each one, you will likely discover further information that will help answer the sub-questions of the other, so it is suggested that you work on the pair together.
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
    
    	- Transparency International's [Integrity Watch](https://data.integritywatch.eu/) includes political integrity information for at least seventeen countries in Europe; depending on the country, this may include political finance data, interest and asset information, and lobbying data. Time ranges covered vary by country; for some countries data may no longer be up-to-date, but can still provide a useful starting point. 
    
    - **Search:** 
    
    	- The site of the country's relevant oversight agency or agencies; these may include, for example, an office of governmental ethics, public integrity agency, etc.
    
    - **Consult:** 
    
    	- Investigative journalists who report on conflicts of interest, public officials' assets, or money in politics more broadly, particularly any who appear to be using aggregate interest and asset data.
    
    	- Officials of civil society organizations that advocate for transparency and accountability regarding money in politics.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **What financial and non-financial information does the data include?** For example, does it include information about interests, assets, and liabilities, as well as gifts?
    
    - **Does the data include information about significant changes in interests or assets?** For example, in response to a change in employment or substantial change in investments? 
    
    - **Whose interests and assets are disclosed?** Does the data only include information about some public officials or does it cover all public officials? Does it include information about the interests and assets of an official's family or other close associates?
    
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?

    * **Negative scoring:**
    
    * **This information is missing required data.** (There is no evidence of data gaps., There is evidence that a portion of mandated data is missing., There is evidence of widespread omissions in mandated data.)
     *In cases where the indicator itself identifies a dataset(s) to assess against—or a separate governance indicator has asked you to determine data requirements of a relevant governing framework—assess against that. In cases where there is no such identified dataset(s) or related governance indicator, please assess based on: the parameters laid out in the publication of the information (e.g., are some fields entirely empty when they shouldn't be?); your local knowledge (e.g., if the data is supposed to include information for all public officials, does the number of total entries seem reasonable?); and any broader research you may have done for this topic (e.g., have media articles decried the incompleteness of this data?). Note: this sub-question examines omissions only of mandated data; so if, for example, laws do not require the reporting of data below certain thresholds, that data is not considered “missing.”*

=== "Indicator Justification"

    
    Interest and asset declarations, sometimes referred to as wealth declarations or financial disclosures, have been used since at least 1960, when the Philippines passed its Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act requiring public officials to declare under oath their assets and liabilities at the beginning and end of their terms in office (Apostol n.d.). In 2003, the adoption of the UN Convention Against Corruption, which includes strong declaration practices, sparked a renewed focus on the declaration as an accountability mechanism. A World Bank study published in 2016 found that 161 of 176 countries had some form of interest and asset declaration, though these showed significant variation (Rossi, Pop, and Berger 2016).
    
    To support government transparency and accountability efforts, this indicator investigates the data that countries make available regarding the interests and assets of public officials.
