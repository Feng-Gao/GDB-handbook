# Background notes & discussion

This section should contain background notes for the design of this indicator. This is a rough working area, and is not for publication. 

Government agencies, civil society and private sector actors may all have access to datasets that, if made available to them, could potentially be used by other stakeholder to:

- **Improve planning and policy making** - for example, the use of data on mobility patterns from private taxi apps to support transport planning.
- **Support crisis response** - for example, sharing of mapping data or logistics datasets following an Earthquake to help first responders, or sharing of health data to support COVID-19 pandemic response.
- **Develop new services** - for example, by training a machine-learning model to monitor crop diseases and pests, or using farm production data to develop improved insurance products.

However, the data used in these applications may be personal, sensitive, or commercially valuable. This can be make it unsuitable for publication as open data, or can mean that data owners are not incentivised to provide it for anyone to use. 

Data sharing arrangements involve making data accessible to a defined group of other stakeholders. 

TODO: 

- [ ]  Locate authority source for this indicator
- [ ]  Add guidance on how to avoid blurring this indicator with data protection legislation indicators

# Indicator drafting

This section contains draft indicator contents, and once this indicator is beyond drafting, should be edited with publication in mind.

## Indicator text

How should this indicator be phrased? Include the indicator question **in bold** followed by any explanatory notes.

**To what extent is there a robust regulatory framework to facilitate data sharing for the public good in the country?**

A robust framework for data sharing for the public good should support government, private sector or civil society to share detailed or sensitive datasets with other stakeholders in order to support public interest goals. 

A robust framework should protect the interests of individuals and communities when data is shared, and should include checks and balances to prevent the abuse of data. 

A robust framework should regulate how data is shared inside government, how data is shared or traded between private sector firms, and how data is shared between private sector and government. 

**Scope notes**

- Data that is shared may, or may not, be suitable to be published as open data. Data sharing will often be used when the data is too sensitive to make available as open data. For example, bulk data about recipients of government services, or health records for use in research.

**Existence**

- There are no national frameworks that regulate data sharing
- There are elements of a framework to regulate data sharing
- There is a well developed framework to regulate data sharing

**Extent**

- 
- Widely applicable

**Elements**

- Consent
- Privacy Impact Assessments
- Transparency
- Oversight & Redress
